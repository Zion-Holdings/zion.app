                  Autonomous systems represent a new frontier for cyber attackers, offering multiple attack vectors that 
                  didn't exist in traditional computing environments. These systems are particularly vulnerable because they:

                  Cybersecurity in autonomous systems is not just a technical challenge—it's a fundamental requirement 
                  for the safe and responsible deployment of automation technologies. Organizations must prioritize security 
                  from the earliest stages of system design and maintain vigilance as threats evolve.

                  Autonomous systems face security challenges that traditional IT systems don't encounter:

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  AI systems that continuously learn and adapt can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs. 
                  Attackers can exploit this by feeding malicious data that gradually shifts the system's behavior 
                  toward undesirable outcomes.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Many autonomous systems operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand why they make 
                  certain decisions. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to detect when a system has been 
                  compromised or is behaving maliciously.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Autonomous systems often need to respond to threats in real-time, leaving little room for human 
                  intervention. This creates a race between attackers and defenders that happens at machine speed.

                  Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns that indicate 
                  potential threats. These systems can detect anomalies in system behavior, network traffic, and 
                  user interactions that might escape traditional rule-based security tools.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  By establishing baseline behavior patterns for autonomous systems, security tools can identify 
                  deviations that might indicate compromise. This approach is particularly effective for detecting 
                  sophisticated attacks that don't trigger traditional signature-based detection.

                  Traditional perimeter-based security models are insufficient for autonomous systems that operate
