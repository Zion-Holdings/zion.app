- **Issues remaining**: 2 (in backup workflows only)
- **Active workflows**: All valid ✅

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Testing (Priority: High)

These workflows are essential for the repository's CI/CD pipeline:

1. **CI Workflows**
   - `ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
   - `ci-lint-types-build.yml` - Lint, type check, and build
   - `ci-quality.yml` - Quality checks
   - `ci-auto-heal.yml` - Auto-healing CI

2. **Security Workflows**
   - `security.yml` - Security audits
   - `security-scan.yml` - Security scanning
   - `gitleaks.yml` - Secret detection

3. **Validation Workflows**
   - `workflow-validator.yml` - Workflow syntax validation
   - `yaml-validator.yml` - YAML validation
   - `actionlint.yml` - Action linting

### Phase 2: Automation Workflows (Priority: Medium)

These workflows handle repository automation:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - `dependencies.yml` - Dependency updates
   - `dependency-maintenance.yml` - Dependency maintenance

2. **Content Management**
   - `readme-autogen.yml` - README generation
   - `sitemap-daily.yml` - Sitemap generation

3. **Monitoring**
   - `workflow-health-monitor.yml` - Workflow health monitoring
   - `netlify-monitor.yml` - Netlify monitoring

### Phase 3: Specialized Workflows (Priority: Low)

These workflows handle specific tasks:

1. **SEO and Marketing**
   - `seo-audit.yml` - SEO auditing
   - `marketing-daily.yml` - Marketing automation

2. **Performance**
   - `performance-audit.yml` - Performance auditing
   - `lighthouse-live.yml` - Lighthouse testing

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Token Required**
   ```bash
   export GH_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
   # or
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Testing Commands

1. **Test Core Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Test CI workflow
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --only ci.yml --wait
   
   # Test security workflow
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --only security.yml --wait
   
   # Test workflow validator
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --only workflow-validator.yml --wait
   ```

2. **Test Multiple Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Test all core workflows
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --only "ci.yml,security.yml,workflow-validator.yml" --wait
   
   # Test with delay between runs
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --only "ci.yml,security.yml" --delay 5000 --wait
   ```

3. **Test with Specific Branch**
   ```bash
   # Test on current branch
   node scripts/trigger-workflows.cjs --ref cursor/run-and-fix-github-actions-workflows-75b8 --only ci.yml
   ```

### Automated Testing Script

Use the provided `analyze-workflows.js` script to validate workflow syntax:

```bash
# Analyze all workflows
node analyze-workflows.js

# Check specific workflow
node -e "
const { analyzeWorkflow } = require('./analyze-workflows.js');
const result = analyzeWorkflow('.github/workflows/ci.yml');
console.log('Valid:', result.valid);
if (!result.valid) console.log('Issues:', result.issues);
"
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks

1. **Weekly**: Run workflow analysis to catch new issues
2. **Monthly**: Review workflow performance and optimize
3. **Quarterly**: Audit workflow permissions and security

### Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Missing step names** - All steps should have descriptive names
2. **Unclosed quotes** - Use YAML block syntax (`|`) for multi-line commands
3. **Invalid YAML syntax** - Validate with `analyze-workflows.js`
4. **Missing permissions** - Ensure workflows have appropriate permissions
5. **Resource conflicts** - Use concurrency groups to prevent overlapping runs

### Best Practices

1. **Always use step names** for better debugging
2. **Use YAML block syntax** for complex shell commands
3. **Set appropriate timeouts** to prevent hanging workflows
4. **Use concurrency groups** to manage resource usage
5. **Test workflows locally** before pushing to main branch

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub token** for automated testing
2. **Test core workflows** using the trigger script
3. **Monitor workflow runs** for any runtime issues
4. **Document any new issues** found during testing
5. **Implement continuous workflow validation** in CI pipeline

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All active workflows pass syntax validation
- ✅ Core CI/CD workflows execute successfully
- ✅ Security workflows run without errors
- ✅ Automation workflows complete their tasks
- ✅ No workflow failures due to syntax or configuration issues
