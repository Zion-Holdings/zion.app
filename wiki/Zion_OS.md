Zion OS is a decentralized AI marketplace protocol that brings together trust, work, and talent on a global scale.[1]

## History and Launch
The project originated in 2023 as part of the Zion Tech Group initiative. Early milestones include the initial MVP launch and onboarding of community contributors.

## Architecture
Zion OS is composed of modular services for identity management, an AI layer (ZionGPT), marketplace contracts, and DAO governance. Modules communicate through a set of open APIs for extensibility.

## Token (ZION$)
ZION$ powers payments, rewards, and governance votes. Distribution includes allocations for founders, community mining, and a protocol treasury.

## ZionGPT and the AI Layer
The platform relies on fine-tuned GPT models to assist with talent matching, content generation, and automated workflows. Local inference is favored when possible, with cloud fallback for larger workloads.

## DAO and Governance
Token holders can submit proposals, debate upgrades, and vote through on-chain mechanisms. Quorum rules and an optional emergency council protect the protocol.

## Use Cases
Businesses can post jobs, manage projects, and engage AI assistants. Communities can launch custom deployments, while individuals maintain portable talent passports.

## Adoption
Pilots are underway across freelance, education, and govtech sectors. Additional integrations and regional deployments are in progress.
