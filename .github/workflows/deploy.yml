      # The build and dependency installation are handled by Netlify's build process,
      # which uses scripts/optimized-build.cjs.
      # This workflow will now focus on Sentry release creation, assuming Netlify
      # has successfully built and deployed this commit from the 'main' branch.

      # It's important that Sentry has access to the sourcemaps generated by the Netlify build.
      # One way is to download them from Netlify if possible, or ensure this workflow
      # can access the same commit and rebuild (less ideal) or point to a source map hosting location.
      # For getsentry/action-release to work with './.next' it implies this job
      # needs to have the build artifacts.
      # If Netlify builds, these artifacts aren't here by default.

      # Option 1: Rebuild here just for sourcemaps (can be slow/resource-intensive)
      # This is the simplest to implement if direct artifact download from Netlify is complex.
