          Generated: $(date)

          ## Current Status
          - Total workflows: $(find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" | wc -l)
          - High frequency workflows: $(grep -r "cron.*\*/[0-9]" .github/workflows/ | wc -l)
          - Workflows without error handling: $(grep -L "continue-on-error\|if: always()" .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

          ## Recommendations

          ### 1. Schedule Optimization
          - Consider consolidating workflows that run at similar times
          - Review workflows running more frequently than necessary
          - Implement staggered scheduling to avoid resource conflicts

          ### 2. Error Handling
          - Add `continue-on-error: true` to non-critical steps
          - Use `if: always()` for cleanup and reporting steps
          - Implement proper retry mechanisms for flaky operations

          ### 3. Resource Management
          - Use concurrency groups to prevent overlapping runs
          - Implement proper timeout values for all jobs
          - Consider using matrix builds for parallel execution

          ### 4. Monitoring
          - Add workflow status reporting
          - Implement failure notifications
          - Track workflow performance metrics

          ## Next Steps
          1. Review high-frequency workflows
          2. Add error handling to critical workflows
          3. Implement monitoring and alerting
          4. Regular performance reviews
