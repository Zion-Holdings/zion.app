            ## Next Steps
            1. Review the workflow logs
            2. Check for configuration issues
            3. Verify dependencies and secrets
            4. Run the auto-healer if needed
            
            ## Auto-Healing
            The Workflow Auto-Healer will attempt to fix common issues automatically.
