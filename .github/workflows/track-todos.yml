          # Base for issue title. The action appends the TODO text.
          # TITLE_TEMPLATE: "TODO: {TODO_TEXT}" # Default is "AUTO: {TODO_TEXT}" by the action

          # Keywords to look for (case-insensitive by default with this action)
          # Default keywords for this action are TODO, FIXME, BUG, HACK, OPTIMIZE, REVIEW
          # We can override if we only want specific ones, or let it use its defaults
          # For this plan, we specified TODO, FIXME, HACK.
          # The action's default handling of multiple keywords is good.
          # If we want *only* these, we'd specify: KEYWORDS: '["TODO", "FIXME", "HACK"]'
          # For now, let's rely on its broader default set and add specific labels.

          # Labels to add to the created issues
          # The action automatically adds a label for the keyword found (e.g., "todo", "fixme").
          # These are additional custom labels.
          LABELS: '["tech-debt", "code-comment"]' # JSON array string for additional labels

          # Who to assign the issue to (GitHub username)
          # ASSIGNEES: '["username1", "username2"]' # Optional

          # How to handle comments that are already issues
          # MODE: "CREATE_ ontwikkeling" # Default, creates new issues.
          # alstr/todo-to-issue-action uses a unique fingerprint in the issue body
          # to avoid creating duplicates if an issue for that specific TODO already exists.

          # Search scope - glob pattern for files to include/exclude
          # Default is to search all text files, excluding .git, node_modules, etc.
          # Refining scope to common source/script directories:
          SCOPE: 'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,py},app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx},pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx},components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx},lib/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx},utils/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx},backend/**/*.{py},scripts/**/*.{js,cjs,mjs,ts,py},packages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,py}'
          # Exclude specific paths if necessary, e.g., "!**/__tests__/**"
          # The action has its own default excludes like node_modules, .git, etc.
          # Adding common directories like 'app', 'packages' for broader coverage.
