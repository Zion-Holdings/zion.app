## üö® Emergency & Recovery

### Emergency Fix & Rollback

- **Trigger:** Manual dispatch only
- **Purpose:** Handle critical issues and rollbacks
- **Features:**
  - Hotfix application
  - Emergency rollbacks
  - Emergency deployments
  - Safety validations
  - Team notifications

## üìã Workflow Configuration

### Permissions
All workflows use minimal required permissions:
- `contents: read/write` - For code access and commits
- `pull-requests: write` - For PR management
- `actions: read` - For workflow information
- `security-events: write` - For security reporting

### Concurrency
Workflows use concurrency groups to prevent conflicts:
- CI workflows cancel in-progress runs
- Automation workflows allow parallel execution
- Emergency actions have dedicated concurrency groups

### Timeouts
Each workflow has appropriate timeouts:
- Quick checks: 10-15 minutes
- Build and test: 20-30 minutes
- Complex automation: 40-45 minutes

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Manual Workflow Dispatch
Most workflows support manual triggering:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select the desired workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Fill in required parameters
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Emergency Actions
For critical situations:
1. Use the Emergency Fix & Rollback workflow
2. Select appropriate action type
3. Provide detailed description
4. Include commit SHA for rollbacks
5. Monitor execution and results

### Monitoring
- Check Actions tab for workflow status
- Review logs for any failures
- Monitor security alerts
- Track deployment status

## üîß Customization

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_OPTIONS`: Memory allocation for Node.js
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`: Disable Next.js telemetry
- `CI`: Enable CI mode

### Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: For Netlify deployments (if needed)

### Scheduling
Workflows use cron expressions for scheduling:
- `0 2 * * 1` - Weekly on Monday at 2 AM UTC
- `0 4 * * *` - Daily at 4 AM UTC
- `0 6 * * *` - Daily at 6 AM UTC
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours

## üìä Metrics & Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- Code coverage uploaded to Codecov
- Test results stored as artifacts
- Performance metrics tracked

### Security Reports
- Vulnerability reports in Security tab
- CodeQL analysis results
- Dependency audit summaries

### Deployment Reports
- Deployment status and URLs
- Build verification results
- Post-deployment check results

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check workflow permissions
2. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout values if needed
3. **Build Failures**: Check CI Self-Heal workflow
4. **Deployment Issues**: Verify Netlify configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting repository secret:
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`: `true`

### Support
For workflow issues:
1. Check workflow logs
2. Review error messages
3. Verify configuration
4. Check permissions and secrets
