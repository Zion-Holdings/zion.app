# 📝 Logs Health Summary (2025-07-11)

## Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD
Executed `npm run logs:health` followed by `npm run logs:health:summary` to review the latest logs. The monitoring script reports good log health but highlighted build and test issues.

## Findings
- **Build Missing**: `.next` directory not found.
- **Test Failures**: 13 Playwright failures detected.
- **Logs**: Health score **100/100** with no errors.
- **Dependencies**: Audit skipped due to lack of network connectivity.
- **Performance**: Server responded in about 29ms.

## Recommendation
Install dependencies, run `npm run build`, and address the failing Playwright tests.
=======

Executed `npm run logs:health` to examine current log files. No runtime errors were found but E2E test logs show Playwright could not launch due to missing browsers.

## Findings

- **System Health**: `npm run logs:health` reports score 100/100.
- **Build Missing**: `.next` directory not present; run `npm run build` after dependencies install.
- **Tests Unavailable**: Jest/Vitest packages missing so unit tests cannot execute.
- **E2E Failures**: `playwright-logs/test-results.json` shows errors `browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist`. Install browsers with `npx playwright install`.
- **Logs**: No critical issues in `next_dev_server.log` or `logs/self-heal.log`.

## Recommendation

Run `./setup.sh npm` then `npx playwright install` to install required browsers. Afterwards, run `npm run build` and `npm test`.
