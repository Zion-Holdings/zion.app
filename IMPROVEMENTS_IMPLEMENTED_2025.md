## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### React Hooks Optimization
```typescript
// Memoized expensive computations
const allServices = useMemo(() => [...], []);
const filteredServices = useMemo(() => [...], [allServices, selectedCategory, searchQuery]);

// Debounced search for performance
const debouncedSearch = useCallback(
  (() => {
    let timeoutId: NodeJS.Timeout;
    return (value: string) => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => setSearchQuery(value), 300);
    };
  })(),
  []
);
```

### Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Throttled scroll handling
useEffect(() => {
  let ticking = false;
  const handleScroll = () => {
    if (!ticking) {
      requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        setIsScrolled(window.scrollY > 20);
        ticking = false;
      });
      ticking = true;
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true });
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

### Accessibility Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced ARIA support
<button
  aria-expanded={activeDropdown === item.label}
  aria-haspopup="true"
  aria-label={`Filter services by ${category}`}
>
  {item.label}
</button>
