// This file was used for react-router-dom route definitions.
// In Next.js, routing is file-system based.
// The routes previously defined here, such as:
// - /deploy/genesis (using GenesisDeployPage with ProtectedRoute)
// should be migrated by creating files like:
// - pages/deploy/genesis.tsx
// The GenesisDeployPage component should be moved to that file,
// and ProtectedRoute logic should be applied within that page component
// or a relevant Next.js layout.

export {}; // Ensure this is treated as a module
