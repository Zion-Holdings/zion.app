// This file was used for react-router-dom route definitions.
// In Next.js, routing is file-system based.
// The routes previously defined here should be migrated by creating
// corresponding files and directories under the 'pages' directory.
// For example:
// - path="/governance" element={<GovernancePage />}
//   should become pages/governance/index.tsx (or pages/governance.tsx) exporting GovernancePage.
// - path="/governance/:proposalId" element={<ProposalDetailPage />}
//   should become pages/governance/[proposalId].tsx exporting ProposalDetailPage.
//
// All components imported at the top (e.g., GovernancePage, CreateProposalPage)
// should be moved to their respective file paths under the 'pages' directory.

export {}; // Ensure this is treated as a module
