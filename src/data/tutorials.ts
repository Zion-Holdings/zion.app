      'This tutorial walks through preparing your data, running the fine-tuning script, and deploying a private GPT endpoint for internal use.\n\n## 1. Gather and Clean Training Data\nCollect text samples relevant to your organization. Remove any sensitive information and check for formatting issues. The quality of your dataset directly impacts model performance.\n\n## 2. Configure the Training Environment\nInstall the necessary libraries such as `transformers` and `datasets`. Ensure you have adequate GPU resources or use a cloud provider that supports large model training.\n\n## 3. Run the Fine-Tuning Script\nUse the provided script to fine-tune the base GPT model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size to achieve the best results.\n\n## 4. Evaluate the Model\nAfter training completes, test the model on sample prompts. Review the output for accuracy and adjust your data or training settings if necessary.\n\n## 5. Deploy a Private Endpoint\nOnce satisfied with the model, containerize it with Docker and deploy to your preferred hosting solution. Restrict network access so only internal applications can reach the API.\n\n## 6. Maintain and Update\nPeriodically retrain the model with new data to keep responses accurate. Monitor performance and resource usage to ensure your private GPT continues to serve users effectively.',;
