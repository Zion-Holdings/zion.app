# Frontend Application Source (`src/`)

This directory contains the primary source code for the Zion platform's Next.js frontend application.

## Overview

The frontend is built using Next.js and React, with TypeScript as the primary language. It's responsible for rendering the user interface, managing client-side state, interacting with various backend APIs, and providing the overall user experience for the platform.

## Key Technologies & Libraries

- **Framework:** Next.js. The project primarily relies on the traditional Pages Router with some gradual adoption of the App Router for newer sections.
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Framework/Libraries:**
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS (assumed, based on `src/index.css` and typical Next.js setups)
  - Chakra UI (`@chakra-ui/react`)
  - Radix UI (`@radix-ui/*`) for unstyled, accessible UI primitives.
  - Shadcn/UI components are used as the base design system, leveraging Radix primitives under the hood.
  - Framer Motion (for animations)
- **State Management:**
  - React Query / SWR (`@tanstack/react-query`, `swr`): For server state, caching, and data synchronization.
  - Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`): For complex client-side state (e.g., cart, wishlist, auth session details).
  - React Context API: For global state like theme, authentication, wallet info, etc.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form is the preferred library. Some legacy components still use Formik or Zod but new code should adopt React Hook Form.
- **API Interaction:** Axios, SWR/React Query's fetch capabilities. Custom clients in `src/api/` and `src/services/`.
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (client-side integration via `AuthProvider` in `src/context/auth/`), interacting with Supabase.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** `i18next`, `react-i18next`.
- **Web3/Decentralization:** Ethers.js, Helia, libp2p, OrbitDB (client-side interactions).
  - Custom `useTokenBalance` hook retrieves ERC20 balances when a wallet is connected.
- **Error Monitoring:** Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`).
- **Testing:**
  - Jest (with React Testing Library) for unit/integration tests (tests primarily in `__tests__/` at root).
  - Storybook (`.storybook/` at root) for component development and testing.

## Directory Structure Highlights

- **`api/`**: Client-side API service functions/wrappers for backend communication.
- **`assets/`**: Static assets like images.
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components, organized by feature or type. This is a very large and critical directory.
- **`config/`**: Frontend-specific configurations.
- **`context/`**: React Context providers for global state.
- **`data/`**: Mock data, static data sets.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for reusable logic.
- **`i18n/` & `locales/`**: Internationalization and localization files.
- **`integrations/`**: Client-side setup for third-party services (Firebase, Supabase client).
- **`layout/`**: Components defining the overall page structure and navigation.
- **`lib/`**: General utility functions and libraries for the frontend.
- **`mobile/`**: Components and pages potentially tailored for a mobile-specific web experience.
- **`pages/` (within `src/`)**: This directory contains page components. Note: Next.js typically uses a root `pages/` or `app/` directory for routing. If this `src/pages/` is the primary one, the root `pages/` might be minimal or for API routes only.
- The `app/` directory hosts a handful of experimental routes using the App Router.
- **`routes/`**: Custom routing logic, protected route components, route configuration.
- **`services/`**: More structured API interaction layer, potentially typed API clients.
- **`store/`**: Redux Toolkit store setup (slices, reducers).
- **`styles/`**: Global stylesheets, CSS modules, Tailwind base.
- **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions.

## Getting Started & Development

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm (ensure versions match project requirements, e.g., Node 20.x).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in the root of the monorepo.
3.  **Environment Variables:**
    - Copy `.env.example` (if it exists at the root or `src/`) to `.env.local`.
    - Populate necessary client-side environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, API keys for third-party services).
4.  **Running the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

## Running Tests

- **Unit/Integration Tests (Jest):**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **E2E Tests (Cypress/Playwright):** Refer to `cypress/README.md` (if exists) or root level instructions. Typically:
  ```bash
  npm run cypress:open
  # or
  npm run playwright test # (or similar, check Playwright scripts)
  ```
- **Storybook (Component Development/Testing):**
  ```bash
  npm run storybook
  ```

## Coding Conventions & Style Guides

- **Linting:** ESLint is used. Run `npm run lint` to check.
- **Formatting:** Prettier is used. Run `npm run format` to format code.
- See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed coding standards and contribution guidelines.

## State Management Strategy

The application employs a hybrid state management approach:

1.  **React Query / SWR:** For managing server state, caching API responses, and handling asynchronous data fetching.
2.  **Redux Toolkit:** For complex global client-side state (e.g., shopping cart, wishlist, detailed auth session info).
3.  **React Context API:** For simpler global state that needs to be shared across components (e.g., theme, basic auth status, wallet connection).

- See [Frontend State Management Guidelines](../docs/frontend_state_management_guidelines.md) for more details on choosing between React Query, Redux Toolkit and React Context.

## Key Architectural Decisions & Notes

- **Component-Driven Development:** Emphasis on reusable components.
- **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Multiple layers of error boundaries.
- **Internationalization:** Built-in support for multiple languages.
- Chakra UI provides high level layout components while Radix supplies low level accessible primitives. Shadcn stitches these pieces together with a consistent design language.
- `AuthProvider` exposes authentication state via React Context and synchronizes with the Redux `authSlice` so that pages and components can access auth data without prop drilling.
