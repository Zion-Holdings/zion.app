2. **Implement parallel execution** for independent tasks
3. **Add retry mechanisms** for transient failures
4. **Optimize resource allocation** for high-usage workflows

### Short-term Improvements (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement workflow caching** to reduce build times
2. **Add performance monitoring** for all critical workflows
3. **Optimize database queries** in data-heavy workflows
4. **Implement circuit breakers** for external API calls

### Long-term Strategy (Next Month)
1. **Migrate to self-hosted runners** for better performance
2. **Implement workflow orchestration** for complex dependencies
3. **Add machine learning** for predictive failure detection
4. **Create workflow templates** for common patterns

## Recommendations

### High Impact, Low Effort
- **Enable workflow caching** (estimated 20% time reduction)
- **Implement retry policies** (estimated 15% failure rate reduction)
- **Add timeout configurations** (estimated 10% resource optimization)

### High Impact, Medium Effort
