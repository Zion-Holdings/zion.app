# Zion Multi-Component Platform

This repository contains the Zion project, a comprehensive platform featuring a web application, backend services, and various specialized modules.

## Overview

The project is structured as a monorepo and includes:

-   **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Located primarily in `src/` (for application code like components, hooks, pages using App Router) and `pages/` (for API routes and potentially older Pages Router content). This is the main user-facing application.
-   **Backend API (Django):** Located in `backend/`. This Python-based backend serves core business logic and data management, likely interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Node.js Backend Services:**
    -   **`server/`:** An Express.js application that provides additional API endpoints, potentially for specific features, BFF patterns, or integration tasks. It connects to MongoDB.
    -   **`api/` (within `pages/api/` or `src/pages/api`):** Next.js API routes providing serverless backend functionality directly within the Next.js application.
-   **Monitoring Service:** Located in `monitoring/`. A Node.js service for monitoring URL performance and health. (See `monitoring/README.md` for details).
-   **Supabase Integration:** Utilizes Supabase for backend-as-a-service features, with functions in `supabase/functions/` and schema definitions in `prisma/` (Prisma is used with Supabase, and potentially also for the Django backend or other Node.js services).
-   **Blockchain/DAO Components:** Directories like `dao/` and `token/` suggest features related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and cryptocurrency tokens.
-   **SDK:** A software development kit is present in `sdk/`, likely for interacting with Zion platform services.
-   **Documentation:** General documentation is in `docs/`, with specific component documentation potentially within their respective directories.
-   **Testing:** Extensive test suites using Vitest and Cypress are in `tests/` and `cypress/`. See **[docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** for common QA steps.
-   **Connect Portal:** Access the portal at `/portal` for account management and settings. The previous `/app` path is deprecated.

## Key Technologies

-   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Chakra UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend (Django):** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL
-   **Backend (Node.js):** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB (for `server/`), Next.js API Routes
-   **Database/BaaS:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, Prisma
-   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (handles login, signup, password reset, social auth) with optional two-factor authentication for the IPO portal
-   **Monitoring:** Custom Node.js service, Sentry, Datadog
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Netlify (including Lighthouse CI)
-   **Other:** IPFS, OrbitDB, Ethers.js, Elasticsearch

## Environment Configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **Supabase for authentication** and **Netlify for environment variable management**. Proper configuration is essential for the application to function correctly.

### Authentication Setup

The application uses Supabase for all authentication functionality:
- User registration and login
- Email verification and password reset
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter)
- Session management and profile handling

### Required Environment Variables

A comprehensive list of environment variables can be found in the `.env.example` file. For local development, create a `.env.local` file and populate it with the necessary values based on `.env.example`. For production deployment (e.g., on Netlify), these variables must be configured in your hosting provider's UI.

**Key variables include:**

-   **Supabase Configuration:**
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    -   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for server-side operations)
-   **NextAuth.js Configuration:**
    -   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (a randomly generated string for signing tokens)
    -   `NEXTAUTH_URL` (the canonical URL of your application)
-   **OAuth Provider Credentials:**
    -   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` & `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` & `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` (and potentially `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`)
    -   Other provider credentials as needed.
-   **Internal Authentication Service:**
    -   `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (if used for specific flows like registration)

Ensure all variables marked as required in `.env.example` or in specific documentation (like `docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`) are correctly set.

### CDN for Static Assets

To improve performance, the application can serve static assets from a CDN.
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` to your CDN domain (e.g., `https://cdn.yourdomain.com`).
When this variable is provided in production builds, Next.js will prefix asset
URLs so they are loaded from the CDN.

### Quick Setup Verification

After setting up environment variables, verify your configuration:

```bash
# Check environment setup
npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/check-env.ts

# Test Supabase connection (in browser console)
console.log('Supabase configured:', !!window.location.origin.includes('localhost') || !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
```

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js (v20+), npm, Python, pip, Docker (recommended).

2.  **Clone the repository.**

3.  **Install project dependencies:** Run the setup script with your preferred
    package manager. Example:
    - `./setup.sh npm` *(default)*
    - `./setup.sh pnpm`
    - `./setup.sh yarn`
    - `./setup.sh bun`
    Ensure you have internet connectivity so dependencies can be downloaded.

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    - For **local development**: Create `.env.local` based on environment variable requirements above
    - For **production**: Set variables in Netlify UI (see deployment guide)
    - Ensure `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` points to your authentication service
    - **Enable DevTools**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVTOOLS=true` in `.env.local` if you want browser DevTools enabled
    - **Validate configuration**: Run `npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/check-env.ts`

5.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    - **Django backend**: Refer to `backend/README.md` or run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    - **Monitoring service**: `cd monitoring && npm install`

6.  **Database Setup:**
    - Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
    - Seed data: `npx prisma db seed`
    - Set up Django database (see backend documentation)

7.  **Running the application:**
    - **Next.js frontend**: `npm run dev` *(automatically validates your development environment)*
    - **Django backend**: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
    - **Node.js server**: `node server/index.js` (or via npm script)

8.  **Verify authentication setup:**
    - Test user registration at `/auth/register`
    - Test login at `/auth/login`
    - Verify email verification flow

9.  **Cleaning caches and logs:**
    - Run `npm run clean:cache` to remove temporary log files and common build caches.
    - Regenerate the sitemap with `npm run sitemap` whenever routes change.

10. **Generate Press Kit Archive:**
    - The downloadable press kit is not stored in the repository.
    - Run `npm run build:media-kit` to create `public/toolkit_assets/media_kit.zip`.

11. **Payment Testing:**
    - **Enable Test Mode:** Ensure `STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for backend) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for frontend) are set in your environment (e.g., `.env.local` or CI/staging environment variables). This forces the application to use Stripe test API keys.
    - **Test Card:** Use the generic Stripe test card:
        - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
        - Expiration Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/30)
        - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
    - **View Transactions:** Test transactions can be viewed in your Stripe Dashboard (ensure "View test data" is enabled).
    - **Demo Products:** If no products appear, run `npm run seed` to populate demo products.
    - **Guest Checkout:** Available at `/marketplace` (add items to cart and proceed to checkout).
    - **Sandbox Login:** For authenticated flows, use development credentials from `.env.local` as described in `docs/SECURITY_CREDENTIALS.md`.
    - **Full Details:** For a comprehensive list of test cards and scenarios, see the detailed guide in **[docs/Payments.md](docs/Payments.md)**.

11. **Contract Tests:**
    - Pact-based contract tests verify that front-end routes match available API endpoints.
    - Start the stub server with `node server/stubServer.js` and run `npm test`.

12. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
    - Set `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
    - Run `npm run test:browserstack` to execute Playwright tests on BrowserStack across desktop and mobile browsers.

13. **Local Cypress Testing:**
    - Copy `cypress.env.example.json` to `cypress.env.json`.
    - Adjust the placeholder values with your test credentials.
    - This prevents "EXISTING_USER_EMAIL" and similar errors during `npm run test:e2e`.

13. **Privacy Policy & Terms (login-gated):**
    - AI-Prompt: "Generate a plain-language summary (‚â§ 200 words) of a standard tech marketplace privacy policy aimed at U.S. users."
    - AI-Prompt: "Write an FAQ with 5 common questions users ask about Zion's Terms of Service."
13. **Frequently Asked Questions:** See [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) or the in-app Help Center for quick answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Supabase not configured" warnings**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set with actual values (not placeholders)
   - Check variable names for typos

2. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify Supabase project is properly configured
   - Check that email authentication is enabled in Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure redirect URLs are configured correctly

3. **Build failures on Netlify**
