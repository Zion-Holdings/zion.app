## üöÄ 2025 Comprehensive Services Portfolio

Home: https://github.com/Zion-Holdings/zion#readme

- **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Located primarily in `src/` (for application code like components, hooks, pages using App Router) and `pages/` (for API routes and potentially older Pages Router content). This is the main user-facing application.
- **Backend API (Django):** Located in `backend/`. This Python-based backend serves core business logic and data management, likely interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Node.js Backend Services:**
  - **`server/`:** An Express.js application that provides additional API endpoints, potentially for specific features, BFF patterns, or integration tasks. It connects to MongoDB.
  - **`api/` (within `pages/api/` or `src/pages/api`):** Next.js API routes providing serverless backend functionality directly within the Next.js application.
- **Monitoring Service:** Located in `monitoring/`. A Node.js service for monitoring URL performance and health. (See `monitoring/README.md` for details).
- **Supabase Integration:** Utilizes Supabase for backend-as-a-service features, with functions in `supabase/functions/` and schema definitions in `prisma/` (Prisma is used with Supabase, and potentially also for the Django backend or other Node.js services).
- **Blockchain/DAO Components:** Directories like `dao/` and `token/` suggest features related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and cryptocurrency tokens.
- **SDK:** A software development kit is present in `sdk/`, likely for interacting with Zion platform services.
- **Documentation:** General documentation is in `docs/`, with specific component documentation potentially within their respective directories.
- **Testing:** Extensive test suites using Vitest and Cypress are in `tests/` and `cypress/`. See **[docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** for common QA steps.
- **Connect Portal:** Access the portal at `/portal` for account management and settings. The previous `/app` path is deprecated.
