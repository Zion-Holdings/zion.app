## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/3fad5ec6-2b6e-4163-b266-afac8f1ced32) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Run the setup script with your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun)
./setup.sh npm  # Default and most compatible option

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev  # Use the same package manager you specified in setup.sh
```

> **IMPORTANT**: This project requires internet access to install dependencies. Without network connectivity, the build process will fail with errors about missing modules like 'react', 'react-router-dom', and 'lucide-react'.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Network Issues

If you see errors related to missing modules like 'react', 'react-dom', or 'lucide-react', your environment may not have internet access to download these dependencies. Options to resolve this:

1. Ensure you have internet connectivity
2. Configure proxy settings if needed: `npm config set proxy http://your-proxy:port`
3. Use a pre-downloaded `node_modules` directory if available

### Package Manager Issues

If you encounter errors running `bun install` (for example, integrity check failures), delete any `bun.lockb` file and run `npm install` instead. This project relies on npm and is not guaranteed to work with Bun. Adding `bun.lockb` to `.gitignore` ensures Bun isn't accidentally used.

For pnpm errors showing "This project is configured to use npm", use `./setup.sh npm` instead as the project may have npm-specific configurations.

## Running Tests

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests. After installing
dependencies via `./setup.sh npm`, run:

```sh
npm run test
```

The tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use JSDOM to simulate the
browser environment.
