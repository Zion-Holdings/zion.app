## Staging Verification

### 1. Route Testing

Visit each critical route and verify:

- [ ] `/` - Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] `/auth/login` - Authentication works
- [ ] `/marketplace` - Product listings display
- [ ] `/dashboard` - User dashboard accessible
- [ ] `/api/health` - Health check passes

### 2. Error Scenarios

Test error handling:

- [ ] Network errors display proper fallback
- [ ] Invalid routes show 404 page
- [ ] Server errors trigger error boundary
- [ ] Retry functionality works
- [ ] Error reporting to Sentry

### 3. Performance

Check critical metrics:

- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Time to First Byte < 800ms
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] First Input Delay < 100ms
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Immediate Checks (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Homepage accessible
- [ ] Critical user flows working
- [ ] No error spikes in monitoring
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] CDN serving assets properly

### 2. Short-term Monitoring (15 minutes - 2 hours)

- [ ] Error rates within normal range
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] User registrations working
