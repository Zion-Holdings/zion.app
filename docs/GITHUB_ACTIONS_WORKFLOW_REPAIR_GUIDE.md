# GitHub Actions Workflow Repair Guide

## üö® Current Status

**Critical Issue Detected**: 167 out of 192 GitHub Actions workflows have YAML syntax errors and structural issues.

- **Total Workflows**: 192
- **Broken Workflows**: 167 (87%)
- **Working Workflows**: 25 (13%)
- **Health Score**: 13%

## üîç Common Issues Identified

### 1. Missing `runs-on:` Specification
**Problem**: Jobs don't specify which runner to use
```yaml
# ‚ùå BROKEN
jobs:
  main:
    name: Main Job
      - name: Checkout repository  # Missing runs-on and steps

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
jobs:
  main:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
```

### 2. Missing `steps:` Section
**Problem**: Steps are not properly nested under a steps section
```yaml
# ‚ùå BROKEN
jobs:
  main:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      - name: Checkout repository  # Missing steps: section

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
jobs:
  main:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
```

### 3. Incorrect Indentation
**Problem**: Steps and their properties have wrong indentation levels
```yaml
# ‚ùå BROKEN
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          node-version: '20'  # Wrong indentation

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
```

### 4. Missing Structural Sections
**Problem**: Workflows lack essential sections like permissions and concurrency
```yaml
# ‚ùå BROKEN
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read

concurrency:
  group: "github.workflow-${{ github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Automated Repair

#### 1. GitHub Actions Auto-Healer
A new workflow has been created that automatically detects and fixes broken workflows:

- **File**: `.github/workflows/workflow-auto-healer.yml`
- **Schedule**: Runs every 6 hours
- **Triggers**: 
  - Manual dispatch
  - After CI failures
  - Scheduled maintenance

#### 2. Local Python Script
A Python script for local workflow repair:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pyyaml

# Run the repair script
python3 scripts/fix-workflows.py
```

### Manual Repair

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Issue**
   ```bash
   # Check YAML validity
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"
   ```

2. **Create Backup**
   ```bash
   cp .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup
   ```

3. **Fix the Structure**
   - Add missing `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
   - Add missing `steps:` section
   - Fix indentation
   - Add missing permissions and concurrency

4. **Validate the Fix**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"
   ```

## üìã Workflow Template

Use this template for new workflows:

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight UTC
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  pull-requests: read

concurrency:
  group: "github.workflow-${{ github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  main:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci --no-audit --no-fund

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```
