# Zion Protocol Whitepaper (Source)

This markdown mirrors the programmatic content used by the app. Edit here and propagate upstream.

## 1. Executive Summary
Zion is an AI-native, talent-first economic protocol that coordinates work, capital, and reputation across a multiverse of sovereign deployments. It fuses AI agents, verifiable talent passports, and programmable markets to create a global operating system for trusted collaboration.

Why now: coordination costs are breaking institutions. AI expands capability but compresses trust. Zion aligns AI, talent, and value with on-chain transparency, minimax attack-surface governance, and credibly neutral settlements.

Ambition: AI + Talent + Trust. Zion turns skills into programmable assets, converts contributions into composable on-chain claims, and routes demand to the best available agents—human or AI—under enforceable rules.

## 2. System Architecture
- Zion OS Modules: Marketplace, AI, Token, DAO, Academy
- Multiverse: region-anchored deployments with shared standards and local policy levers
- ZionGPT Core: decentralized prompt/inference mesh with fallback to external APIs

Developer detail includes modules, multiverse, and ZionGPT Core internals.

## 3. Tokenomics
- Roles: rewards, fees, staking
- Distribution: community, grants, treasury, founders, partners
- Policy: emissions decay, buyback/burn, slashing
- Governance: 1 ZION$ = 1 vote with optional quadratic overlays and reputation gates

## 4. Governance
ZGP proposal lifecycle, DAO mechanics, emergency council scope, region quorums.

## 5. AI Stack
Prompt infra, fine-tuning loop, on-platform inference with API fallback.

## 6. Use Cases
Freelance work, incubator, GovTech, talent passports.

## 7. Roadmap
v1–v10 milestones, expansion, integrations, sovereign infra.
