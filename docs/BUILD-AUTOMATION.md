# 🚀 Build Automation System

This document describes the comprehensive build automation system implemented to fix Netlify build issues and prevent future failures.

## 🎯 Overview

The build automation system addresses the critical issues identified in the Netlify build failure:

1. **Missing `_headers` file** - Automatically created if missing
2. **Network connectivity issues** - Retry logic and graceful error handling
3. **Security vulnerabilities** - Automated scanning and fixing
4. **Deprecated dependencies** - Monitoring and update automation
5. **Build performance** - Caching and optimization

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. Pre-build Validation Script (`scripts/pre-build-check.sh`)

**Purpose**: Validates the build environment before starting the build process.

**Features**:
- Checks for required files (`_headers`, `_redirects`)
- Creates missing files with default content
- Runs security audits
- Validates environment variables
- Checks for deprecated packages

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/pre-build-check.sh
```

### 2. Network Utilities (`utils/network-utils.js`)

**Purpose**: Provides robust network handling with retry logic and error handling.

**Features**:
- `fetchWithRetry()` - Fetch with exponential backoff retry
- `checkServicesHealth()` - Health check for external services
- `validateBuildTimeNetwork()` - Build-time network validation
- `gracefulFetch()` - Graceful fetch wrapper for build processes

**Usage**:
```javascript
import { fetchWithRetry, checkServicesHealth } from '../utils/network-utils';

// Fetch with retry
const response = await fetchWithRetry('https://api.example.com/data');

// Check service health
const health = await checkServicesHealth(['https://api1.com', 'https://api2.com']);
```

### 3. Health Check API (`pages/api/health.js`)

**Purpose**: Provides application health monitoring endpoint.

**Features**:
- Service health status
- Environment information
- Node.js version and uptime
- Critical service checks

**Endpoint**: `/api/health`

### 4. Build Automation Script (`scripts/build-automation.js`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive build automation with full validation and monitoring.

**Features**:
- Environment validation
- File validation and auto-creation
- Dependency checking
- Network validation
- Build execution
- Comprehensive reporting

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run build:automated
```

### 5. GitHub Actions

#### Dependency Update Workflow (`.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically updates dependencies and fixes security vulnerabilities.

**Schedule**: Every Monday at 2 AM
**Features**:
- Automatic dependency updates
- Security vulnerability fixes
- Pull request creation
- Automated testing

#### Build Monitor Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-monitor.yml`)

**Purpose**: Monitors builds and creates issues on failures.

**Schedule**: Every 6 hours
**Features**:
- Build health monitoring
- Pre-build validation
- Build testing
- Issue creation on failures
- Automated alerts

## 🔧 Configuration

### Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

The build command has been updated to include pre-build validation:

```toml
[build]
  command = "chmod +x scripts/pre-build-check.sh && ./scripts/pre-build-check.sh && npm ci && npm run export"
```

### Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)

Build caching and performance optimizations have been added:

```javascript
experimental: {
  buildCache: true,
},
generateBuildId: async () => {
  return 'build-' + Date.now();
},
webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
  if (!dev && !isServer) {
    config.cache = {
      type: 'filesystem',
      buildDependencies: {
        config: [__filename],
      },
    };
  }
  return config;
}
```

## 📋 Usage

### Manual Build with Validation

```bash
# Run pre-build validation
npm run prebuild:validate

# Run automated build
npm run build:automated

# Standard build
npm run build
```

### Automated Builds

The system automatically runs during:
- Netlify deployments
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Scheduled maintenance

### Monitoring

Monitor build health through:
- GitHub Issues (automatically created on failures)
- Build reports (`build-report.json`)
- Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- GitHub Actions logs

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing `_headers` file**
   - The system automatically creates this file
   - Check the build logs for auto-creation messages

2. **Network connectivity issues**
   - The system includes retry logic
   - Check the network validation logs
   - Verify external service availability

3. **Security vulnerabilities**
   - Run `npm audit fix --force`
   - Check the automated dependency update workflow
   - Review the security audit logs

4. **Build failures**
   - Run `npm run build:automated` for comprehensive diagnostics
   - Check the generated `build-report.json`
   - Review GitHub Issues for automated alerts

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
DEBUG=* npm run build:automated
```

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Review dependency update PRs
2. **Monthly**: Review build performance metrics
3. **Quarterly**: Update critical endpoints in network validation

### Monitoring

- Watch GitHub Issues for build failures
- Monitor GitHub Actions for workflow success rates
- Review build reports for trends

## 📊 Metrics

The system tracks:
- Build success/failure rates
- Validation pass/fail rates
- Security vulnerability counts
- Network connectivity status
- Build performance metrics

## 🤝 Contributing

To improve the build automation system:

1. Update the validation scripts
2. Add new health checks
3. Improve error handling
4. Add new monitoring capabilities
5. Update documentation
