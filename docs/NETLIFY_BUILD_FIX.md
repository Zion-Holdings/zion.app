# Netlify Build Fix: MockUser Type Error

## Issue Description

The Netlify build failed with the following TypeScript error:

```
./pages/api/auth/login.ts:78:33
Type error: Property 'emailVerified' does not exist on type 'MockUser'.
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred because:

1. The login tracing implementation added `emailVerified` property to the user data
2. The `MockUser` TypeScript interface was not updated to include this new property
3. TypeScript compilation failed when trying to access `user.emailVerified` on line 78

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated MockUser Interface (`pages/api/users/data.ts`)

```typescript
export interface MockUser {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  bio?: string;
  points: number;
  notifications: { email: boolean; push: boolean };
  softDeleted?: boolean;
  password?: string; // Added for development authentication
  emailVerified?: boolean; // Added for email verification testing
}
```

### 2. Updated TypeScript Definition (`pages/api/users/data.d.ts`)

```typescript
export interface MockUser {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    avatarUrl: string;
    bio?: string;
    points: number;
    notifications: {
        email: boolean;
        push: boolean;
    };
    softDeleted?: boolean;
    password?: string; // Added for development authentication
    emailVerified?: boolean; // Added for email verification testing
}
```

### 3. Updated User Data with emailVerified Property

Added `emailVerified` property to all test users:

```typescript
export const users: Record<string, MockUser> = {
  '1': {
    // ... other properties
    emailVerified: true, // Email is verified
  },
  '2': {
    // ... other properties  
    emailVerified: true, // Email is verified
  },
  '3': {
    // ... other properties
    emailVerified: false, // Email not verified - for testing 403 response
  },
};
```

## Files Modified

- `pages/api/users/data.ts` - Added `emailVerified` to interface and user data
- `pages/api/users/data.d.ts` - Added `emailVerified` to type definition
- `pages/api/users/data.js` - Already had the property (was updated previously)

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Creating a minimal TypeScript test with the problematic code pattern
2. Running `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck test-minimal.ts` 
3. Confirming the compilation now passes without errors

## Build Status

âœ… **FIXED**: The Netlify build should now pass successfully with the updated MockUser interface that includes the `emailVerified` property.

## Related Implementation

This fix is part of the login tracing implementation that includes:

- Verbose logging for authentication attempts
- Email verification status checking
- Enhanced error handling with specific error codes
- bcrypt password comparison support

The `emailVerified` property enables the email verification flow:

```typescript
// Email verification check in login API
if (user.emailVerified === false) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'Email verification required',
    message: 'Verify email',
    code: 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED'
  });
}
```
