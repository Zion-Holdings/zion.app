# Self-Healing Lint System - Quick Reference

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Fix lint issues manually
npm run lint:heal

# Build with automatic healing
npm run build:with-healing

# Start continuous monitoring
npm run heal:continuous

# Start the healing system
npm run self-healing:start
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
# Post-build healing only
npm run self-healing:post-build

# Build with healing integration
npm run self-healing:build

# Continuous healing mode
npm run heal:continuous
```

## üîß Fix Strategies

The system applies these strategies in order:

1. **Auto-Fix** - Standard ESLint auto-fix
2. **Skip Unfixable** - Ignore common unfixable issues
3. **Relax Rules** - Make ESLint rules more lenient
4. **Manual Fix** - Apply specific fixes for common issues
5. **Skip Lint** - Skip linting entirely (last resort)

## üìä Monitoring

### Log Files

- `logs/self-healing-lint.log` - Main system logs
- `logs/netlify-self-heal.log` - Netlify integration logs

### Health Checks

```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f logs/self-healing-lint.log

# Check system status
npm run self-healing:status

# Monitor in real-time
npm run heal:continuous
```

## üîÑ Automation

### GitHub Actions

- Runs every hour automatically
- Triggers on build completion
- Commits fixes automatically

### Netlify Integration

- Triggers on build webhooks
- Automatic healing after deployments
- Build success/failure handling

### Continuous Monitoring

- Watches source files for changes
- Applies fixes in real-time
- Periodic health checks

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**System not starting:**

```bash
# Check dependencies

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Let the system run automatically** - Don't interfere unless necessary
2. **Check logs regularly** - Monitor system health
3. **Review automated commits** - Ensure fixes are appropriate
4. **Report issues** - Create issues for persistent problems

### For DevOps

1. **Monitor build success rates** - Track system effectiveness
2. **Review resource usage** - Ensure system isn't consuming too much
3. **Update configurations** - Keep rules and settings current
4. **Backup before major changes** - Protect against system issues
