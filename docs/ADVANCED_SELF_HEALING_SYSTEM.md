    "build:with-healing": "npm run build && npm run advanced-heal:monitor",
    "postbuild": "npm run advanced-heal:monitor"
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration

For continuous integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/self-healing.yml
name: Self-Healing System
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *' # Every 30 minutes

jobs:
  self-healing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run advanced-heal:start
      - run: npm run improvement:start
```

### Netlify Integration

For Netlify deployments:

```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:with-healing"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Environment Setup

- Set up all required environment variables
- Configure Cursor API access
- Ensure Git credentials are properly configured

### 2. Monitoring

- Regularly check system logs for any issues
- Monitor improvement metrics and success rates
- Review Cursor chat recommendations

### 3. Maintenance

- Periodically review and update error patterns
- Optimize system configuration based on usage
- Clean up old log files and reports

### 4. Security

- Keep Cursor API keys secure
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Monitor for any security-related issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cursor API Connection Failed**
   - Verify `CURSOR_API_KEY` and `CURSOR_WORKSPACE_ID` are set
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure API key has proper permissions

2. **Git Push Failed**
   - Verify Git credentials are configured
   - Check branch permissions
   - Ensure no merge conflicts exist

3. **Build Issues Persist**
   - Check for fundamental configuration problems
   - Review error logs for root causes
   - Consider manual intervention for complex issues

4. **System Performance**
   - Monitor memory usage and CPU utilization
   - Adjust intervals if system is overloaded
   - Consider running on dedicated infrastructure

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# Set debug environment variable
export DEBUG=true

# Start system with debug logging
npm run advanced-heal:start
```

### Manual Override

If automatic fixes aren't working:

```bash
# Stop automatic systems
npm run advanced-heal:stop
npm run improvement:stop

# Apply manual fixes
npm run lint:fix
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# Restart systems
npm run advanced-heal:start
npm run improvement:start
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Error Patterns

Add custom error patterns in `scripts/advanced-self-healing-system.cjs`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  errorPatterns: {
    'Custom Error': {
      type: 'custom',
      fix: 'custom_fix_function',
      severity: 'medium',
      cursorPrompt: 'Fix custom error pattern',
    },
  },
};
```

### Custom Fix Strategies

Implement custom fix strategies:

```javascript
const fixStrategies = {
  custom: async () => {
    // Implement custom fix logic
    console.log('Applying custom fix...');
    // Your custom fix implementation
  },
};
```

### Performance Tuning

Optimize system performance:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  // Reduce intervals for faster response
  healthCheckInterval: 60000, // 1 minute
  autoCommitInterval: 300000, // 5 minutes

  // Increase limits for more aggressive fixing
  maxIssuesPerRun: 50,
  minIssuesForChat: 2,
};
```
