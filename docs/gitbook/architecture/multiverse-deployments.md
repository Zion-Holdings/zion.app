# Multiverse Deployments

Zion OS supports multiple deployments ("universes"): mainnet, L2s, appchains, and private sandboxes.

## Patterns
- Hub-and-spoke: shared identity and token, per-universe markets
- Sovereign deployments: local tokens bridged to ZION$ routing
- Federation: shared standards, independent governance

## Data & State
- Onchain: escrow, staking, voting
- Offchain: search indexes, metadata caches
- Cross-domain: bridges, relayers, and optimistic syncing

## Interop
- Adapters for escrow/voting modules per chain
- Unified SDK that auto-selects providers and endpoints
