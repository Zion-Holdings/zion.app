# Governance

## Proposal Lifecycle
Ideas are drafted, discussed, and then submitted on-chain. Once a quorum threshold is met, the proposal moves to voting.

## Quorum & Voting Rules
A minimum percentage of circulating ZION$ must participate for a vote to pass. Simple majority wins unless otherwise specified.

## ZION$ Role
Holders stake tokens to gain voting power, receive marketplace rewards, and unlock premium features.

## Delegate Structure
Members can delegate their vote weight to trusted representatives who vote on their behalf.

## Emergency Override
An optional guardian multisig can pause the protocol in case of critical issues.
