# Quorum & Voting Rules

## Voting Methods
- Token-weighted (1 ZION$ = 1 vote) with delegation
- Optional: quadratic or conviction voting for specific modules

## Thresholds (example)
- Quorum: min(10% of circulating ZION$, 50M)
- Approval: YES ≥ 50% of votes cast; for upgrades YES ≥ 66%
- Veto: Security Council can veto with 5-of-9 multisig (time-limited)

## Timing
- Voting Period: 5–7 days
- Timelock: 48–96 hours before execution

## Anti-Capture
- Delegation caps per address (soft)
- Cooldown for repeat proposals by the same author
- Onchain simulation and audit requirement for sensitive changes
