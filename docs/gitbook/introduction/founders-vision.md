# Founder's Vision

Zion envisions a world where talent flows freely and coordination costs approach zero. Markets, governance, and AI collaborate to produce public goods and sustainable open economies.

## Principles
- Open by default: permissively licensed specs and SDKs
- Onchain where it matters: value, state, and verifiable logic
- AI-native: assistants and agents as first-class protocol citizens
- User sovereignty: portable identity, data, and reputation
- Credible neutrality: transparent rules and shared infrastructure

## North Star Metrics
- Successful jobs and milestone completion rate
- Time-to-first-quote and time-to-hire
- Participation and proposal pass rates in governance
- Retained value in the network (staked, fees, rewards)
