# Zion OS - High-Level Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Zion OS platform architecture. Zion OS is a complex system integrating a modern web frontend, multiple backend services, AI capabilities, Web3 features, and various third-party integrations. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive marketplace and ecosystem for tech, AI, talent, and services.

## 2. Core Components & Technologies

### 2.1. Frontend Application

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Key Features:** User interface for all platform interactions, marketplace, user dashboards, admin panels, content display, DAO interactions.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, React Context API.
- **Client-side Data Fetching:** SWR, React Query, Axios.

### 2.2. Backend Services & APIs

#### 2.2.1. Next.js API Routes

- **Location:** `pages/api/*`
- **Role:** Primary API layer for frontend interactions, handling business logic, authentication, and orchestrating calls to other services (Supabase, Django, external APIs).
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js for session management and provider integration.

#### 2.2.2. Supabase

- **Role:**
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL as the primary relational database.
  - **Authentication:** User authentication and management.
  - **Real-time Services:** Used for features requiring real-time updates (e.g., messaging, notifications).
  - **Storage:** File storage for user-generated content or application assets.
  - **Serverless Functions:** Supabase Functions for specific backend logic.
- **Integration:** Accessed from Next.js API routes and potentially directly from the frontend for some features.

#### 2.2.3. Django Backend (Legacy/Specific Services)

- **Location:** `backend/` directory.
- **Role:** Provides specialized features such as the IPO portal and certain admin tools that have not yet been migrated to the Next.js stack. These services expose REST endpoints that are consumed by Next.js API routes.
- **Database:** May have its own SQLite database for legacy features but can also connect to the shared Supabase Postgres instance when needed.

#### 2.2.4. Node.js Services (Express, etc.)

- **Evidence:** Presence of `server/` directory with Express setup, `api/` with plain JS files.
- **Role:** Handles standalone microservices such as webhook receivers for blockchain events and scheduled jobs for data synchronization. These services communicate with the main application via REST or queue messages.

### 2.3. AI & GPT Services (ZionGPT)

- **Role:** Provides AI-powered features such as content generation, matching algorithms, chatbots, data analysis.
- **Implementation:** Likely involves custom models, fine-tuning of pre-trained models, and integration with third-party AI APIs.
- **Interaction:** Accessed via API calls from the Next.js backend or specialized frontend components.
- **Services:** A collection of fine-tuned models accessible under `/api/gpt`. Data is retrieved from Supabase, processed by the models, and returned to the requesting component. Training utilities live in `scripts/train-zion-gpt.js`.

### 2.4. Web3 & Decentralization Components

- **Technologies:** Helia, IPFS, libp2p, ethers.js, Solidity (for DAO contracts).
- **Role:**
  - **DAO & Governance:** Smart contracts for voting, proposals, and treasury management.
  - **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Helia):** Potential for storing user data, NFTs, or other assets in a decentralized manner.
  - **Peer-to-Peer Networking (libp2p):** For direct communication or data exchange.
- **Integration:** Interacted with via frontend components (wallet connections) and backend services.
- **Features:** Smart contracts in the `dao/` directory manage governance and token flows. Assets can be stored on IPFS via Helia and pinned for persistence. libp2p enables peer-to-peer data exchange for future decentralized modules.

### 2.5. Database & Data Storage

- **Primary Relational DB:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase).
- **Search:** Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities across listings, content, etc.
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS/Helia.
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage, potentially Cloudinary for media.
- **Caching:** Redis or similar might be used (not explicitly seen, but common).

### 2.6. Key External Service Integrations

- **Payments:** Stripe.
- **Error Monitoring & Logging:** Sentry.
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics.
- **Email & Communication:** SendGrid (for transactional emails), Mailchimp (for newsletters).
- **Cloud Hosting/Deployment:** Netlify (inferred from `netlify.toml` and build plugins).
- **Social Logins/Firebase:** Firebase for some auth/utility functions.
- **CRM/Sales:** Salesforce.
- **Team Communication:** Microsoft Teams (webhooks).
- **Image Management:** Cloudinary (inferred from `next-cloudinary` dependency).

## 3. Key Architectural Principles & Patterns

- **Monorepo Structure:** Codebase contains multiple related projects/services.
- **Serverless Functions:** Leveraging Next.js API routes and Supabase Functions.
- **Microservices (Potential):** Django and Node.js services might operate as microservices.
- **Event-Driven (Potential):** For real-time updates and decoupled services.
- **API-First Design:** Frontend relies on well-defined APIs.
- **Security:** Secrets are stored in environment variables and error monitoring is handled by Sentry.
- **Data Privacy:** Supabase row-level security ensures users can access only their own data.
- **Scalability:** Services are containerized and can be scaled horizontally on Netlify or Kubernetes.

## 4. Data Flow Examples

### 4.1. User Registration & Login

1.  User interacts with Signup/Login form (Next.js frontend).
2.  Frontend calls Next.js API route (`/api/auth/...`).
3.  API route interacts with NextAuth.js, which in turn uses Supabase Auth (or other providers) to create/verify user.
4.  Session is established, JWT may be issued.
5.  User data might be synced to other services if needed (e.g., local profile table, CRM).

### 4.2. Marketplace Listing Creation

1.  User fills out form on frontend.
2.  Frontend submits data to Next.js API route.
3.  API route validates data, potentially processes images/media (e.g., uploads to Cloudinary/Supabase Storage).
4.  Data is saved to Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.
5.  Data is indexed in Elasticsearch.
6.  (If Web3) Relevant metadata might be prepared for IPFS and/or NFT minting.

### 4.3. AI-Powered Recommendation

1.  User browses content or performs an action.
2.  Frontend or backend service sends context data to a ZionGPT API endpoint.
3.  AI service processes data, runs models, and returns recommendations.
4.  Recommendations are displayed on the frontend.

## 5. Future Considerations & Areas for Documentation

- Detailed diagrams for key data flows.
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions.
- Scalability and performance tuning strategies.
- Security architecture and threat model.
- Data backup and recovery procedures.
- CI/CD pipeline details.
- Contribution and coding guidelines specific to different parts of the stack.
