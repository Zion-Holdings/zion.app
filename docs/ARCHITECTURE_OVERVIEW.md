# Zion OS - High-Level Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Zion OS platform architecture. Zion OS is a complex system integrating a modern web frontend, multiple backend services, AI capabilities, Web3 features, and various third-party integrations. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive marketplace and ecosystem for tech, AI, talent, and services.

## 2. Core Components & Technologies

### 2.1. Frontend Application
*   **Framework:** Next.js (React)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Key Features:** User interface for all platform interactions, marketplace, user dashboards, admin panels, content display, DAO interactions.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, React Context API.
*   **Client-side Data Fetching:** SWR, React Query, Axios.

### 2.2. Backend Services & APIs

#### 2.2.1. Next.js API Routes
*   **Location:** `pages/api/*`
*   **Role:** Primary API layer for frontend interactions, handling business logic, authentication, and orchestrating calls to other services (Supabase, Django, external APIs).
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js for session management and provider integration.

#### 2.2.2. Supabase
*   **Role:**
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL as the primary relational database.
    *   **Authentication:** User authentication and management.
    *   **Real-time Services:** Used for features requiring real-time updates (e.g., messaging, notifications).
    *   **Storage:** File storage for user-generated content or application assets.
    *   **Serverless Functions:** Supabase Functions for specific backend logic.
*   **Integration:** Accessed from Next.js API routes and potentially directly from the frontend for some features.

#### 2.2.3. Django Backend (Legacy/Specific Services)
*   **Location:** `backend/` directory.
*   **Role:** Potentially provides specialized services (e.g., IPO portal, advanced data processing, specific business logic not migrated to Next.js/Supabase). *[Team to verify and detail current active roles and integration points with the main Next.js application.]*
*   **Database:** May have its own database (e.g., SQLite found, or could connect to Supabase's Postgres).

#### 2.2.4. Node.js Services (Express, etc.)
*   **Evidence:** Presence of `server/` directory with Express setup, `api/` with plain JS files.
*   **Role:** May handle specific microservices, webhook endpoints, or auxiliary tasks. *[Team to verify and detail current active roles and integration points.]*

### 2.3. AI & GPT Services (ZionGPT)
*   **Role:** Provides AI-powered features such as content generation, matching algorithms, chatbots, data analysis.
*   **Implementation:** Likely involves custom models, fine-tuning of pre-trained models, and integration with third-party AI APIs.
*   **Interaction:** Accessed via API calls from the Next.js backend or specialized frontend components.
*   *[Team to detail specific ZionGPT services, their architecture, and data flow.]*

### 2.4. Web3 & Decentralization Components
*   **Technologies:** Helia, IPFS, libp2p, ethers.js, Solidity (for DAO contracts).
*   **Role:**
    *   **DAO & Governance:** Smart contracts for voting, proposals, and treasury management.
    *   **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Helia):** Potential for storing user data, NFTs, or other assets in a decentralized manner.
    *   **Peer-to-Peer Networking (libp2p):** For direct communication or data exchange.
*   **Integration:** Interacted with via frontend components (wallet connections) and backend services.
*   *[Team to detail specific Web3 features, contract interactions, and decentralized data strategies.]*

### 2.5. Database & Data Storage
*   **Primary Relational DB:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase).
*   **Search:** Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities across listings, content, etc.
*   **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS/Helia.
*   **File Storage:** Supabase Storage, potentially Cloudinary for media.
*   **Caching:** Redis or similar might be used (not explicitly seen, but common).

### 2.6. Key External Service Integrations
*   **Payments:** Stripe.
*   **Error Monitoring & Logging:** Sentry.
*   **Analytics:** Google Analytics.
*   **Email & Communication:** SendGrid (for transactional emails), Mailchimp (for newsletters).
*   **Cloud Hosting/Deployment:** Netlify (inferred from `netlify.toml` and build plugins).
*   **Social Logins/Firebase:** Firebase for some auth/utility functions.
*   **CRM/Sales:** Salesforce.
*   **Team Communication:** Microsoft Teams (webhooks).
*   **Image Management:** Cloudinary (inferred from `next-cloudinary` dependency).

## 3. Key Architectural Principles & Patterns
*   **Monorepo Structure:** Codebase contains multiple related projects/services.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Leveraging Next.js API routes and Supabase Functions.
*   **Microservices (Potential):** Django and Node.js services might operate as microservices.
*   **Event-Driven (Potential):** For real-time updates and decoupled services.
*   **API-First Design:** Frontend relies on well-defined APIs.
*   *[Team to add more specific principles like security best practices, data privacy considerations, scalability strategies etc.]*

## 4. Data Flow Examples

### 4.1. User Registration & Login
1.  User interacts with Signup/Login form (Next.js frontend).
2.  Frontend calls Next.js API route (`/api/auth/...`).
3.  API route interacts with NextAuth.js, which in turn uses Supabase Auth (or other providers) to create/verify user.
4.  Session is established, JWT may be issued.
5.  User data might be synced to other services if needed (e.g., local profile table, CRM).

### 4.2. Marketplace Listing Creation
1.  User fills out form on frontend.
2.  Frontend submits data to Next.js API route.
3.  API route validates data, potentially processes images/media (e.g., uploads to Cloudinary/Supabase Storage).
4.  Data is saved to Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.
5.  Data is indexed in Elasticsearch.
6.  (If Web3) Relevant metadata might be prepared for IPFS and/or NFT minting.

### 4.3. AI-Powered Recommendation
1.  User browses content or performs an action.
2.  Frontend or backend service sends context data to a ZionGPT API endpoint.
3.  AI service processes data, runs models, and returns recommendations.
4.  Recommendations are displayed on the frontend.

## 5. Future Considerations & Areas for Documentation
*   Detailed diagrams for key data flows.
*   Sequence diagrams for complex interactions.
*   Scalability and performance tuning strategies.
*   Security architecture and threat model.
*   Data backup and recovery procedures.
*   CI/CD pipeline details.
*   Contribution and coding guidelines specific to different parts of the stack.
