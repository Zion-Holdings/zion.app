# Duplicate Pages Cleanup

## Problem Description

The Next.js application was experiencing duplicate page warnings because both compiled JavaScript (`.js`) and TypeScript source (`.tsx`/`.ts`) files were present in the `pages/` directory. This caused Next.js to detect multiple routes for the same page, resulting in warnings like:

```
⚠ Duplicate page detected. pages/_error.tsx and pages/_error.js both resolve to /_error.
⚠ Duplicate page detected. pages/404.tsx and pages/404.js both resolve to /404.
```

## Root Cause

The repository contained both:
1. **Source files**: TypeScript/React files (`.tsx`, `.ts`)
2. **Compiled artifacts**: JavaScript files (`.js`) and TypeScript declarations (`.d.ts`)

This happened because:
- TypeScript files were being compiled to JavaScript during development
- Both source and compiled files were being committed to the repository
- Next.js treats both as valid page routes, causing duplication

## Solution Applied

### 1. Automated Cleanup Script

Created `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-pages.js` that:
- Scans the `pages/` directory for duplicate files
- Identifies cases where both `.tsx`/`.ts` and `.js` versions exist
- Removes the compiled `.js` and `.d.ts` files, keeping only source files
- Provides dry-run capability for safety

### 2. Files Removed

**Total files removed**: 335 files
- 166 JavaScript files (`.js`)
- 169 TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`)

### 3. Remaining Clean Structure

After cleanup:
- **148** TypeScript React files (`.tsx`) - UI pages and components
- **34** TypeScript files (`.ts`) - API routes and utilities
- **0** JavaScript files (`.js`)
- **0** TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`)

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Updated `.gitignore`

Added patterns to prevent future duplication:

```gitignore
# Prevent compiled JS files from being committed when TS/TSX source exists
# These should be generated at build time, not committed
pages/**/*.js
pages/**/*.d.ts
```

### 2. Build Process

TypeScript files are now properly:
- Compiled at build time by Next.js
- Not committed as compiled artifacts
- Only source files tracked in version control

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated duplicate page warnings** - Clean Next.js routing
2. **Reduced repository size** - Removed ~335 redundant files
3. **Improved maintainability** - Single source of truth for each page
4. **Faster builds** - No conflicting file resolution
5. **Better development experience** - Clear, non-ambiguous routing

## Usage

To run the cleanup script in the future (if needed):

```bash
# Dry run - see what would be deleted
node scripts/cleanup-duplicate-pages.js

# Actually perform cleanup
node scripts/cleanup-duplicate-pages.js --delete
```

## Impact on Build Process

- **Development**: `npm run dev` now processes only TypeScript source files
- **Production**: `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to optimized JavaScript
- **No functional changes**: All pages work identically, just cleaner structure

This cleanup resolves the duplicate page warnings while maintaining full application functionality.
