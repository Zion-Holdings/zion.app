# Zion OS Unified Deployment Protocol

This guide describes the process for launching a new Zion instance in any region or industry. Use it to deploy complete ecosystems that combine the talent marketplace, AI assistants, DAO governance, identity management, education modules and partner APIs.

## 1. Deployment Inputs

### Instance name
Provide a descriptive label such as `Zion LATAM`, `Zion AI Health` or `Zion Egypt`.

### Configuration options
- **Domain/Subdomain** for the new instance
- **Industry vertical** – General, Health, Education, Law or Government
- **Default language**
- **Token system** – share the global `ZION$` token or create a local currency
- **Governance type** – Admin, DAO‑lite or Full DAO

### Feature toggles
Check the boxes to enable any of these modules:
- Marketplace (jobs, talent, projects)
- ZionGPT core assistant
- Resume builder and proposal AI
- Token system with rewards
- On‑chain contract builder
- KYC/AML and identity verification
- DAO proposal voting
- Incubator and grants portal
- Zion Academy education hub
- API access for partners
- Regional or institutional dashboards
- White‑label vendor plugins
- Web3 login with decentralized ID
- Multi‑currency support

## 2. Deployment actions
Submitting the form triggers several automated tasks:
1. Generate a CMS instance using the selected vertical presets
2. Configure a default DAO (if enabled)
3. Create partner API keys
4. Provision the landing page and login flows
5. Set up a placeholder blog and roadmap

## 3. Operator workflows
After deployment, background processes start automatically:
- Localized ZionGPT prompt stacks are loaded
- A resume fine‑tuner job is scheduled
- KYC checks and Web3 wallet verification are synced
- Region‑specific job categories and wage baselines are loaded
- Default manifestos and constitutions are created

## 4. Admin view
Administrators can monitor the new instance through a central control panel showing:
- User count and talent/client ratio
- Current governance mode
- Token wallet activity
- Job flow statistics

Actions include **Push to Public**, **Clone Config** and **Deploy to IPFS**.

## 5. UX highlights
- Visual instance tree showing `Zion Global` and sub‑marketplaces
- Color‑coded dashboards per deployment
- Map view for the global Zion footprint

## 6. Access and security
- Only superadmins can deploy new instances
- All deployment actions are logged for audit purposes
- Secrets such as API keys and GPT models are stored with encryption

## 7. Optional add‑ons
- Payment gateway selector
- Sovereign DAO treasury wallet
- Dual governance (local DAO with global veto)
- AI moderation per vertical
- Government or institutional affiliate panels

With this protocol Zion can launch plug‑and‑play digital economies anywhere, powered by AI, talent and trust.
