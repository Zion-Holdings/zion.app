- **System Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checks every 15 minutes
- **Emergency Recovery**: Automatic recovery for failed systems
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed coverage analytics every 2 hours

### 3. Enhanced Startup Script (`start-comprehensive-coverage.sh`)
- **One-Command Startup**: Starts all systems with proper dependency checking
- **Status Management**: Easy status checking, stopping, and restarting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Package.json Integration
- **Easy Access**: `npm run coverage:start` to start everything
- **Status Commands**: `npm run coverage:status` for system status
- **Health Checks**: `npm run coverage:health` for system health
- **Reporting**: `npm run coverage:report` for detailed reports
