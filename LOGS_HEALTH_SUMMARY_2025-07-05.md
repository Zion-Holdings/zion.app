# üìù Logs Health Summary (2025-07-05)

## Overview

Running `npm run logs:health:summary` generated an updated `logs/health-summary.json` on **2025-07-05T14:54:20Z**. No runtime errors were detected.
A second execution at **2025-07-05T21:05:15Z** confirmed the logs remain clean with a health score of **100/100**.

## Findings

- **Build**: _missing_ (`.next` directory not found)
- **Tests**: passing (0 failures)
- **Logs**: score **100/100** with zero errors
- **Dependencies**: no vulnerabilities or outdated packages

Overall project health scored **75/100 (C)** with a "Fair" status. The main issue is the missing production build. Once a build is generated the score should improve.

## Recommendation

Generate a production build and keep monitoring logs with `npm run logs:health`.
