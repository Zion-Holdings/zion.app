# 🛠️ Error Logging Dashboard Improvements

## Overview

The monitoring stack now provides richer visibility into runtime errors. Datadog dashboards were refined to surface detailed traces and LogRocket was introduced for session replay.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Datadog Dashboards**: Improved widgets and filters for JS errors
- ✅ **LogRocket Integration**: Session replay with automatic error correlation
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Build fails if Datadog or LogRocket are misconfigured

## Setup

1. Add the following variables to your `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DD_CLIENT_TOKEN="<datadog-token>"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGROCKET_ID="<logrocket-id>"
   ```
2. Deploy the application and verify logs appear in both platforms.

## Benefits

- 📈 Faster debugging with linked traces
- 🎥 Replay user sessions to reproduce issues
