# Open Pull Requests Merge Summary

## Progress Made

I have successfully resolved merge conflicts and merged several open pull requests into the main branch. Here's what has been accomplished:

### Successfully Merged Branches

1. **origin/cursor/test-and-fix-netlify-functions-workflows-1ae9**
   - Added 146 new files including Netlify functions and automation scripts
   - Resolved conflicts in .gitignore and report files
   - Added comprehensive automation infrastructure

2. **origin/3bk25l-codex/fix-test-expectation-for-fetch-rejection**

   - Resolved conflicts in authentication routes and services

### Current Status

- **Local main branch**: 25 commits ahead of origin/main
- **Working tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Conflicts resolved**: All merge conflicts have been successfully resolved

### Remaining Work

There are still many unmerged branches that need attention:

- **Total unmerged branches**: 100+ branches still need to be processed
- **Complex branches**: Some branches have significant conflicts that require careful manual resolution
- **Dependency branches**: Some branches may depend on others being merged first

## Recommendations for Continuing

### 1. Push Current Progress
```bash
# First, fetch the latest remote changes
git fetch origin

# Then force push (since we've resolved conflicts)
git push origin main --force
```

### 2. Continue with Systematic Merging
- Focus on smaller, focused branches first
- Use the merge scripts created (merge_open_prs.sh, smart_merge.sh)
- Handle complex branches with many conflicts separately

### 3. Conflict Resolution Strategy
- **Simple conflicts**: Use `git checkout --theirs` for straightforward cases
- **Complex conflicts**: Manually review and resolve line by line
- **Configuration conflicts**: Keep the more recent/complete version

### 4. Testing After Each Merge
- Run tests to ensure no regressions
- Check that the application builds successfully
- Verify key functionality works

### 5. Batch Processing
- Group similar branches together
- Process related functionality in batches
- Maintain a clean commit history

## Next Steps

1. **Push current progress** to remote repository
2. **Continue with systematic merging** of remaining branches
3. **Focus on low-conflict branches** first
4. **Handle complex branches** with careful manual review
5. **Test thoroughly** after each major merge

## Tools Created

- `merge_open_prs.sh`: Basic merge automation script
- `smart_merge.sh`: Advanced merge script with conflict resolution strategies

These scripts can be used to continue the automation process for the remaining branches.
