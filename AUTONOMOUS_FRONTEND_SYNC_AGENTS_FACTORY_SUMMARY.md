# Autonomous Frontend Sync Agents Factory Summary

- Files:
  - `automation/frontend-sync-autonomous-analyzer.cjs`
  - `automation/frontend-sync-autonomous-factory.cjs`
  - `automation/frontend-sync-autonomous-orchestrator.cjs`
  - `automation/frontend-sync-autonomous-cron.sh`
  - `automation/launch-frontend-sync-autonomous.js`
- Purpose: Provide an independent, continuously running pipeline that detects FE changes, generates specialized sync agents, and executes them, without altering existing factories/orchestrators.
- Behavior:
  - Analyzer writes `data/reports/frontend-sync/autonomous/frontend-sync-autonomous-actions.json` with actions based on recent file/git changes.
  - Factory reads the autonomous report and generates agents into `automation/frontend-sync-autonomous-agents/`.
  - Orchestrator runs analyzer → factory → executes generated agents on a configurable interval (default 5 minutes).
  - Cron script allows one-off periodic execution, if desired.
- Why: Ensure newly created pages and improvements are propagated to the running frontend (e.g., sitemap refresh, style updates, auto pages refresh) even if base orchestrators are idle.
