## üöÄ How to Use

### Manual Workflow Triggering

Use the provided trigger script:

```bash
./trigger-workflows.sh
```

Or use GitHub CLI directly:

```bash
# Trigger CI workflow
gh workflow run ci.yml

# Trigger deployment to staging
gh workflow run deploy.yml --field environment=staging

# Trigger maintenance task
gh workflow run maintenance.yml --field task=dependencies

# Trigger specific test type
gh workflow run test-validation.yml --field test-type=unit
```

### Workflow Inputs

#### Deploy Workflow
- `environment`: Choose between `staging` or `production`
- `force`: Force deployment even if checks fail

#### Maintenance Workflow
- `task`: Choose between `all`, `dependencies`, `cleanup`, `security`, or `health-check`

#### Test & Validation Workflow
- `test-type`: Choose between `all`, `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `performance`, or `accessibility`

#### Automation Factories Workflow
- `factory`: Specify a particular factory to run (leave empty for all)
- `force`: Force execution even if previous run is in progress

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required Secrets

Some workflows require GitHub secrets to be configured:

- `SNYK_TOKEN`: For Snyk security scanning
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub

### Environment Configuration

The deploy workflow uses GitHub environments:
- `staging`: For staging deployments
- `production`: For production deployments

Configure these in your repository settings under Environments.

### Concurrency Control

All workflows implement concurrency control to prevent race conditions:
- CI: `ci-${{ github.ref }}` (per branch)
- Deploy: `deploy-${{ github.ref }}` (per branch)
- Maintenance: `maintenance` (global)
- Automation Factories: `automation-factories` (global)
- Test & Validation: `test-validation-${{ github.ref }}` (per branch)

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Artifacts

All workflows generate artifacts that are automatically uploaded:
- Test results and coverage reports
- Build artifacts and bundles
- Security scan results
- Performance metrics
- Factory output and logs

### Status Notifications

Each workflow provides comprehensive status reporting:
- Job-level status updates
- Summary reports
- Failure notifications
- Success confirmations

### Dashboard

View all workflow runs and their status at:
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Workflows

1. Create a new `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Follow the established patterns for:
   - Permissions and security
   - Concurrency control
   - Error handling
   - Artifact management
   - Status reporting

### Modifying Existing Workflows

All workflows are designed to be easily customizable:
- Environment variables for configuration
- Conditional job execution
- Configurable timeouts and resources
- Extensible step definitions

### Local Testing

Test workflows locally using:
```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/workflow.yml'))"

# Check for common issues
./fix-github-actions-comprehensive.sh
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**: Check trigger conditions and branch names
2. **Permission denied**: Verify workflow permissions and repository settings
3. **Job timeout**: Adjust `timeout-minutes` in workflow files
4. **Concurrency conflicts**: Check concurrency group settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the secret:
```
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
```

### Health Checks

Run the comprehensive fixer to identify and resolve issues:
```bash
./fix-github-actions-comprehensive.sh
```
