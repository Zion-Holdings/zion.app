## üöÄ 2025 Comprehensive Services Portfolio

We've expanded our portfolio with **36+ innovative micro SAAS, IT, and AI services** designed to transform businesses across all industries.

- **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Located primarily in `src/` (for application code like components, hooks, pages using App Router) and `pages/` (for API routes and potentially older Pages Router content). This is the main user-facing application.
- **Backend API (Django):** Located in `backend/`. This Python-based backend serves core business logic and data management, likely interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Node.js Backend Services:**
  - **`server/`:** An Express.js application that provides additional API endpoints, potentially for specific features, BFF patterns, or integration tasks. It connects to MongoDB.
  - **`api/` (within `pages/api/` or `src/pages/api`):** Next.js API routes providing serverless backend functionality directly within the Next.js application.
- **Monitoring Service:** Located in `monitoring/`. A Node.js service for monitoring URL performance and health. (See `monitoring/README.md` for details).
- **Supabase Integration:** Utilizes Supabase for backend-as-a-service features, with functions in `supabase/functions/` and schema definitions in `prisma/` (Prisma is used with Supabase, and potentially also for the Django backend or other Node.js services).
- **Blockchain/DAO Components:** Directories like `dao/` and `token/` suggest features related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and cryptocurrency tokens.
- **SDK:** A software development kit is present in `sdk/`, likely for interacting with Zion platform services.
- **Documentation:** General documentation is in `docs/`, with specific component documentation potentially within their respective directories.
- **Testing:** Extensive test suites using Vitest and Cypress are in `tests/` and `cypress/`. See **[docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** for common QA steps.
- **Connect Portal:** Access the portal at `/portal` for account management and settings. The previous `/app` path is deprecated.

# bolt.new.zion.app

Autonomous, cloud‚Äënative app with self‚Äërunning automations.

Home: https://github.com/Zion-Holdings/zion#readme

### Highlights
- **Autonomous cloud automations**: GitHub Actions run on schedules to maintain, audit, and improve the repo without human intervention.
- **Rapid sync**: A 1-minute cadence keeps branches synchronized.
- **Self-healing CI**: Automatic detection and PRs for fixes after failures.

### Key Directories
- `automation/`: Cloud automation scripts (content, SEO, security, sync).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts (sitemap, SEO, radar, README generator).
- `pages/`: Next.js pages.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components.

3.  **Install project dependencies:** Run the setup script with your preferred
    package manager. Example:
    - `./setup.sh npm` _(default)_
    - `./setup.sh pnpm`
    - `./setup.sh yarn`
    - `./setup.sh bun`
      Ensure you have internet connectivity so dependencies can be downloaded.

### Local Development
1. Install Node 20+ and npm 10+.
2. Install deps: `npm ci`.
3. Run dev: `npm run dev`.

### Maintenance Commands
- `npm run git:sync` ‚Äì Advanced git sync
- `npm run automation:cloud` ‚Äì Run cloud orchestrator locally
- `npm run sitemap` ‚Äì Regenerate sitemap
- `npm run readme:generate` ‚Äì Refresh this README

<<<<<<< HEAD
7.  **Running the application:**
    - **Next.js frontend**: `npm run dev` _(automatically validates your development environment)_
    - **Django backend**: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
    - **Node.js server**: `node server/index.cjs` (or via npm script)

8.  **Verify authentication setup:**
    - Test user registration at `/auth/register`
    - Test login at `/auth/login`
    - Verify email verification flow

9.  **Cleaning caches and logs:**
    - Run `npm run clean:cache` to remove temporary log files and common build caches.
    - Regenerate the sitemap with `npm run sitemap` whenever routes change.
    - Fix any accidental `react-router` links by running `node scripts/fix-link-hrefs.cjs`.

10. **Generate Press Kit Archive:**
    - The downloadable press kit is not stored in the repository.
    - Run `npm run build:media-kit` to create `public/toolkit_assets/media_kit.zip`.

11. **Payment Testing:**
    - **Enable Test Mode:** Ensure `STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for backend) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for frontend) are set in your environment (e.g., `.env.local` or CI/staging environment variables). This forces the application to use Stripe test API keys.
    - **Test Card:** Use the generic Stripe test card:
      - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
      - Expiration Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/30)
      - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
    - **View Transactions:** Test transactions can be viewed in your Stripe Dashboard (ensure "View test data" is enabled).
    - **Demo Products:** If no products appear, run `npm run seed` to populate demo products.
    - **Guest Checkout:** Available at `/marketplace` (add items to cart and proceed to checkout).
    - **Sandbox Login:** For authenticated flows, use development credentials from `.env.local` as described in `docs/SECURITY_CREDENTIALS.md`.
    - **Full Details:** For a comprehensive list of test cards and scenarios, see the detailed guide in **[docs/Payments.md](docs/Payments.md)**.

12. **Contract Tests:**
    - Pact-based contract tests verify that front-end routes match available API endpoints.
    - Start the stub server with `node server/stubServer.js` and run `npm test`.

13. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
    - Set `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
    - Run `npm run test:browserstack` to execute Playwright tests on BrowserStack across desktop and mobile browsers.

14. **Local Cypress Testing:**
    - Copy `cypress.env.example.json` to `cypress.env.json`.
    - Adjust the placeholder values with your test credentials.
    - This prevents "EXISTING_USER_EMAIL" and similar errors during `npm run test:e2e`.

15. **Privacy Policy & Terms (login-gated):**
    - AI-Prompt: "Generate a plain-language summary (‚â§ 200 words) of a standard tech marketplace privacy policy aimed at U.S. users."
    - AI-Prompt: "Write an FAQ with 5 common questions users ask about Zion's Terms of Service."

16. **Self-Healing Lint System:**
    - The project includes an automated lint fixing system that runs after builds
    - **Manual healing**: `npm run lint:heal` or `npm run heal:lint`
    - **Continuous monitoring**: `npm run heal:continuous`
    - **Build with healing**: `npm run build:with-healing`
    - **Start healing system**: `npm run self-healing:start`
    - See [Self-Healing Lint System Guide](docs/SELF_HEALING_LINT_SYSTEM.md) for complete documentation

17. **Frequently Asked Questions:** See [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) or the in-app Help Center for quick answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Supabase not configured" warnings**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set with actual values (not placeholders)
   - Check variable names for typos

2. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify Supabase project is properly configured
   - Check that email authentication is enabled in Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure redirect URLs are configured correctly

3. **Build failures on Netlify**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in Netlify UI
   - Check build logs for specific TypeScript or dependency errors
4. **Blank screen when starting the app**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed by running `./setup.sh npm`
   - Run `npm run fix:loading` to diagnose and apply the emergency loader
   - A fail-safe message will now appear if the page stays blank for a few seconds
   - Detection logic improved to catch cases where only stylesheets or scripts are rendered
   - See [docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md](docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
5. **Playwright browsers missing**
   - If end-to-end tests fail with `browserType.launch` errors, run `npx playwright install` to download the required browsers

6. **Lint errors and warnings**
   - The self-healing lint system automatically fixes most issues after builds
   - **Manual fix**: Run `npm run lint:heal` to apply fixes immediately
   - **Continuous monitoring**: Start `npm run heal:continuous` for real-time fixing
   - **Build with healing**: Use `npm run build:with-healing` to automatically fix issues during build
   - **Check status**: Run `npm run self-healing:status` to see system health
   - See [Self-Healing Lint System Guide](docs/SELF_HEALING_LINT_SYSTEM.md) for advanced troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Supabase Authentication Setup Guide](docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md).

## üöÄ Performance & Monitoring

### Performance Metrics

- **Server Response Time**: ~2.6s (initial compilation) ‚Üí ~83ms (cached)
- **Image Optimization**: ~10ms response time with WebP/AVIF support
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with chunk splitting and tree shaking
- **Build Time**: Improved with selective experimental features

### Health Checks

Run comprehensive performance and health checks:

```bash
# Full performance audit
npm run perf:monitor

# Environment validation
npm run env:dev

# Bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze
```

### Key Optimizations Applied

1. **Image Optimization**: Fixed 400 errors, added comprehensive domain support
2. **Webpack Configuration**: Optimized chunking, reduced serialization warnings
3. **Sentry Integration**: Conditional loading, graceful fallbacks
4. **Environment Handling**: Enhanced validation, placeholder detection
5. **CSS Optimization**: Production-only to avoid development conflicts
6. **Error Handling**: Improved user experience, reduced console spam

### Monitoring Dashboard

The application includes built-in monitoring for:

- Server health and response times
- Image optimization performance
- File system integrity
- Environment configuration validation
- Error reporting and analytics
- **Self-healing lint system** - Automated lint error detection and fixing

### Troubleshooting Blank Screens

If the application loads with a completely empty page, it usually means
the required `node_modules` directory is missing. Check `next_dev_server.log`
for errors and reinstall dependencies:

If the app logs **"Error loading tenant"** during startup, the request to the
Supabase edge function that provides whitelabel settings failed. Confirm that
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in your environment and
that you have network connectivity. The tenant hook will retry a few times
before giving up.

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```sh
npm run test
```

To watch tests during development:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

### Self-Maintenance Automation

The project includes several automations that help it heal itself and stay up to date:

Open Cypress for interactive debugging:

```sh
npm run cypress:open
```

## üöÄ Advanced Self-Healing System

The Zion App includes a comprehensive **Advanced Self-Healing System** that automatically detects, fixes, and improves the application continuously.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the advanced self-healing system
npm run advanced-heal:start

# Start the continuous improvement pipeline
npm run improvement:start

# Check system status
npm run advanced-heal:status
npm run improvement:status
```
