# Merge Conflict Resolution and PR Merging Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive scripts to resolve all merge conflicts and merge open PRs into the main branch.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To resolve all merge conflicts and merge PRs automatically:

```bash
bash complete-merge-resolution.sh
```

## 📋 What These Scripts Do

### 1. **Initial Conflict Detection** (`step1-check-conflicts.sh`)
- Checks known problematic branches for conflicts
- Identifies which branches have merge conflicts with main

### 2. **First Branch Resolution** (`step2-resolve-conflicts.sh`)
- Resolves conflicts in `fix-merge-conflict-in-next-build-5681`
- Handles file deletion conflicts automatically

### 3. **Second Branch Resolution** (`step3-resolve-second-branch.sh`)
- Resolves conflicts in `fix-merge-conflict-in-nextjs-build-f246`
- Handles multiple file deletion conflicts

### 4. **Main Branch Update** (`step4-merge-to-main.sh`)
- Merges all resolved conflicts into main branch
- Pushes updated main branch to GitHub

### 5. **Remaining PRs Check** (`check-remaining-prs.sh`)
- Systematically checks all remaining branches for conflicts
- Auto-resolves deletion conflicts
- Identifies branches needing manual review

## 🔧 How It Works

### Auto-Resolution Strategy
The scripts automatically resolve the most common type of conflict:
- **File Deletion Conflicts**: When a file exists in a feature branch but was deleted in main
- **Solution**: Remove the file (following main branch's decision)

### Manual Resolution Required For
- **Code Logic Conflicts**: When the same file has different content in both branches
- **File Addition Conflicts**: When both branches add different files with the same name
- **Complex Merge Scenarios**: When automatic resolution could cause data loss

## 📊 Expected Results

After running the complete script, you should see:

```
🎉 COMPLETE MERGE RESOLUTION PROCESS FINISHED!
==============================================

📊 FINAL SUMMARY:
✅ Initial conflicts resolved and merged
✅ Additional branches checked and processed
✅ Main branch updated with all resolved conflicts

🔍 NEXT STEPS:
1. Check GitHub for the updated main branch
2. Verify that resolved PRs can be closed
3. Test the main branch for stability
4. Handle any remaining manual conflicts if needed

🚀 Main branch is now ready with all resolved conflicts!
```

## 🛠️ Manual Steps (If Needed)

If any branches require manual review:

1. **Check the conflict details**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b manual-review origin/cursor/branch-name
   git merge origin/main --no-commit --no-ff
   ```

2. **Review conflicted files**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```

3. **Resolve conflicts manually**:
   - Edit conflicted files
   - Remove conflict markers
   - Choose which changes to keep

4. **Complete the merge**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Manual conflict resolution"
   git checkout main-branch
   git merge manual-review
   ```

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

### Check Current Status
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

### View Branch Status
```bash
git branch -a
git remote show origin
```

### Check for Remaining Conflicts
```bash
git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main) HEAD origin/main
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backup**: These scripts modify your local repository. Ensure you have a backup or can reset to origin/main
2. **Testing**: After merging, test the main branch to ensure stability
3. **GitHub Sync**: The scripts push to main, but you may need to close PRs manually on GitHub
4. **Manual Review**: Some conflicts may require human judgment and cannot be auto-resolved

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Scripts Fail
1. **Reset to clean state**:
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/main
   git checkout -b fresh-start
   ```

2. **Check Git status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

3. **Manual conflict resolution** (see manual steps above)

### Common Issues
- **Permission denied**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x *.sh`)
- **Branch not found**: Some branches may have been deleted or renamed
- **Merge conflicts persist**: Some conflicts require manual resolution

## 📈 Success Metrics

After running these scripts, you should have:
- ✅ All auto-resolvable conflicts resolved
- ✅ Main branch updated with resolved changes
- ✅ Clear list of branches needing manual review
- ✅ Reduced number of open PRs with conflicts

## 🔄 Iterative Process

If you have many branches with conflicts, you may need to:
1. Run the scripts
2. Handle manual conflicts
3. Re-run for remaining branches
4. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the script output for error messages
2. Review the Git status and logs
3. Use manual resolution for complex conflicts
4. Consider creating a new clean branch from main if needed
