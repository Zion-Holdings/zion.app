# Critical Workflow Recovery Plan

## Current Situation
- **192 workflow files** exist but are severely corrupted
- **25 files** pass basic YAML validation but may have functional issues
- **167 files** have structural corruption that prevents YAML parsing
- Automated fixes have failed due to deep structural issues
- No clean backup exists in git history

## Recovery Strategy: Recreate Essential Workflows

### Phase 1: Core CI/CD Pipeline (Immediate Priority)

#### 1.1 Main CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
**Purpose**: Primary continuous integration pipeline
**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Code checkout
- Node.js setup
- Dependency installation
- Linting and testing
- Build verification
- Security scanning

#### 1.2 Testing Workflow (`test.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing automation
**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (if applicable)
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance testing

#### 1.3 Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated deployment to staging/production
**Triggers**: Push to main, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Environment-specific deployment
- Health checks
- Rollback capability
- Deployment notifications

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Next Priority)

#### 2.1 Security Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated security vulnerability detection
**Triggers**: Daily schedule, push to main, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- Security policy enforcement

#### 2.2 Code Quality (`code-quality.yml`)
**Purpose**: Maintain code quality standards
**Triggers**: Pull requests, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Linting (ESLint, Prettier)
- Type checking
- Code formatting
- Complexity analysis

### Phase 3: Maintenance and Monitoring (Lower Priority)

#### 3.1 Dependency Management (`dependency-management.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated dependency updates
**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Dependabot integration
- Automated PR creation
- Security updates
- Version compatibility checks

#### 3.2 Performance Monitoring (`performance-monitoring.yml`)
**Purpose**: Track application performance
**Triggers**: Daily schedule, manual dispatch
**Components**:
- Lighthouse CI
- Bundle size analysis
- Performance regression detection
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Create Minimal Working Templates
- Start with basic, functional workflow structures
- Focus on essential functionality first
- Ensure YAML syntax is correct
- Test each workflow individually

### Step 2: Validate and Test
- Verify YAML syntax with multiple validators
- Test workflow execution in GitHub
- Monitor for errors and fix iteratively
- Ensure proper trigger conditions

### Step 3: Enhance and Optimize
- Add advanced features gradually
- Implement proper error handling
- Add monitoring and notifications
- Optimize performance and resource usage

## Success Criteria

### Day 1 Goals
- [ ] 3 core workflows functional (CI, Test, Deploy)
- [ ] All workflows pass YAML validation
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] No critical workflow failures

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] 5+ workflows fully functional
- [ ] Automated testing operational
- [ ] Deployment automation working
- [ ] Security scanning active
- [ ] Performance monitoring established

### Month 1 Goals
- [ ] 10+ workflows operational
- [ ] Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Quality gates established
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- Create git commits after each successful workflow
- Maintain working workflow templates
- Document all changes and configurations
- Test workflows in isolation before integration

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original corrupted files as reference
- Maintain git history for all changes
- Create recovery checkpoints
- Have fallback workflow configurations ready

### Testing Strategy
- Test workflows individually first
- Validate integration points carefully
- Monitor system performance during recovery
- Have fallback options ready

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create core CI workflow template
2. **Next 2 hours**: Implement and test CI workflow
3. **Next 4 hours**: Add testing and deployment workflows
4. **Next 8 hours**: Validate and optimize all workflows
5. **Next 24 hours**: Document and plan next phase

## Conclusion

The recovery approach focuses on creating a solid foundation with essential workflows rather than attempting to repair severely corrupted files. This ensures a reliable CI/CD pipeline while establishing best practices for future workflow development.
