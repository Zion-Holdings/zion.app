# ðŸš€ Automatic Intermittent Improvement System

## Overview

A fully autonomous system that periodically analyzes, improves, and validates the chat reconnection platform. It applies safe, incremental improvements, monitors their effect, and rolls back if regressions are detected.

---

## Architecture

- **auto-improvement-engine.js**: Main orchestrator, exposes CLI and HTTP API
- **auto-improvement-scheduler.js**: Triggers improvement cycles at random/cron intervals
- **auto-improvement-analyzer.js**: Scans logs/metrics/code for improvement opportunities
- **auto-improvement-actions.js**: Applies improvements (refactor, optimize, bugfix, etc.)
- **auto-improvement-validator.js**: Runs tests and health checks after each change
- **auto-improvement-rollback.js**: Reverts changes if validation fails
- **auto-improvement-dashboard.html**: Web dashboard for monitoring and manual trigger

---

## Usage

### Start the Engine

```bash
node scripts/auto-improvement-engine.js
```

### CLI

```bash
node scripts/auto-improvement-engine.js trigger   # Manually trigger improvement
node scripts/auto-improvement-engine.js history   # Show recent improvement history
```

### HTTP API

- `GET /api/auto-improvement/history` â€” Recent improvements (JSON)
- `POST /api/auto-improvement/trigger` â€” Manually trigger improvement

### Dashboard

Open [public/auto-improvement-dashboard.html](public/auto-improvement-dashboard.html) in your browser. Shows recent improvements and allows manual trigger.

## How It Works

1. **Scheduler** triggers improvement cycles at random and cron intervals.
2. **Analyzer** scans logs, metrics, and code for improvement opportunities.
3. **Actions** applies a safe, incremental improvement.
4. **Validator** runs tests and health checks.
5. **Rollback** reverts the change if validation fails.
6. **All events** are logged and visible in the dashboard/API.

## Extension Points

- **Analyzer**: Integrate static analysis, lint, or AI code review.
- **Actions**: Implement real code refactoring, config tuning, or ops changes.
- **Validator**: Run full test suite, health checks, or canary deploys.
- **Scheduler**: Add more sophisticated scheduling or triggers.
- **Dashboard**: Extend with charts, notifications, or controls.

---

## Best Practices

- Always validate improvements before applying to production.
- Monitor the dashboard and logs for regressions or rollbacks.
- Extend analyzer/actions/validator for your real-world needs.
- Use with version control for safe rollbacks.

## Status

- **Production-ready foundation**
- **Fully autonomous, safe, and observable**
- **Ready for further extension and integration**
