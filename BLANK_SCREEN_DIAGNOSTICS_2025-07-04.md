# Blank Screen Diagnostic Report
*Generated: 2025-07-04*

## Summary
- A blank screen issue was reported when loading the app.
- Running `npm run fix:loading` failed because dependencies could not be installed due to network restrictions.
- Diagnostics show that `node_modules` is missing, preventing the build from succeeding.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Ensure internet access is available.
2. Run `./setup.sh npm` to install dependencies.
3. Rebuild the project with `npm run build` and start the server with `npm run dev`.

See the captured log excerpt below for reference:

🚨 EMERGENCY APP LOADING FIX
============================

🔍 Checking app loading status...
❌ node_modules directory is missing
   -> Attempting to install dependencies via "./setup.sh npm"
  6. If still stuck, use emergency app component

🎯 IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY:
==========================
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Chrome/Firefox)
2. Clear cache: F12 → Application → Storage → Clear site data
3. Check console: F12 → Console tab for errors
4. Rebuild: npm run build && npm run start

✅ App should now load within 3 seconds max!
