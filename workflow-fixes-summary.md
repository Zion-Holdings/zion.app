### 4. Generic Name Fixes (1 workflow fixed)
- **ci.yml**: Renamed to `continuous-integration.yml` and updated workflow name for better clarity

## Current Status

✅ **All 227 workflows are now healthy and properly configured**

## Validation Results

- **Workflow Health Check**: ✅ Passed
- **YAML Syntax Validation**: ✅ All workflows have valid syntax
- **Comprehensive Fix Script**: ✅ No additional fixes needed
- **Structural Validation**: ✅ All workflows have proper structure

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Security**: Fixed overly permissive permissions across multiple workflows
2. **Artifact Management**: Added proper retention policies for uploaded artifacts
3. **YAML Structure**: Corrected syntax errors and indentation issues
4. **Workflow Naming**: Improved clarity by renaming generic workflow names
5. **Step Structure**: Fixed malformed workflow steps

## Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes**: All fixes are ready to be committed to the repository
2. **Monitor Workflows**: Watch for any runtime issues when workflows are triggered
3. **Regular Validation**: Run the validation scripts periodically to maintain workflow health
4. **Test Execution**: Consider testing key workflows manually to verify they run successfully
