# React Version Conflict Fix

## Problem Description

The Netlify build was failing with the following error:

```
unhandledRejection Error: Minified React error #527; visit https://react.dev/errors/527?args[]=18.2.0&args[]=19.1.1 for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.
```

This error indicates a React version mismatch between React 18.2.0 and React DOM 19.1.1 during the build process.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by:
1. **Peer dependency resolution conflicts** during the Netlify build process
2. **Next.js internal dependency resolution** pulling in different React versions
3. **Lack of strict version enforcement** in the build configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Package.json Overrides
Added strict version overrides to force consistent React versions:

```json
"overrides": {
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "18.2.0"
}
```

### 2. Next.js Configuration
Enhanced `next.config.js` with React version enforcement:

```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    'react': require.resolve('react'),
    'react-dom': require.resolve('react-dom'),
  };
  
  config.resolve.fallback = {
    ...config.resolve.fallback,
    'react': require.resolve('react'),
    'react-dom': require.resolve('react-dom'),
  };
  
  return config;
}
```

### 3. NPM Configuration
Created `.npmrc` file to ensure consistent dependency resolution:

```ini
legacy-peer-deps=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
auto-install-peers=true
react@18.2.0
react-dom@18.2.0
```

### 4. Build Scripts
Created comprehensive build scripts to handle version conflicts:

- `scripts/prepare-build.js` - Prepares build environment
- `scripts/check-react-versions.js` - Verifies React versions
- `scripts/netlify-build.js` - Comprehensive Netlify build process
- `scripts/test-react-versions.js` - Tests React version enforcement

### 5. Netlify Configuration
Updated `netlify.toml` to use the new build process:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run netlify:build"
  publish = "out"

[build.environment]
  SKIP_REACT_VERSION_CHECK = "true"
  LEGACY_PEER_DEPS = "true"
```

## Usage

### Test React Versions
```bash
npm run test:react-versions
```

### Run Export with Version Checks
```bash
npm run export
```

### Run Netlify Build
```bash
npm run netlify:build
```

## Build Process

The new build process includes:

1. **Dependency Installation** - Clean install with `npm ci`
2. **Build Environment Preparation** - Force correct React versions
3. **Version Verification** - Check React version consistency
4. **Build Execution** - Run Next.js build with enforced versions
5. **Output Verification** - Ensure build output is created

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables for the build:

- `SKIP_REACT_VERSION_CHECK=true` - Skip Next.js React version checks
- `LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true` - Use legacy peer dependency resolution
- `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=6144 --openssl-legacy-provider"` - Memory and OpenSSL settings

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails

1. **Clear Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Version Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:react-versions
   ```

3. **Check for Conflicts**:
   ```bash
   npm ls react react-dom
   ```

4. **Force Reinstall React**:
   ```bash
   npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 --force
   ```

### Common Issues

- **Peer dependency conflicts** - Ensure `legacy-peer-deps=true` in `.npmrc`
- **Version resolution** - Check that overrides are correctly set in `package.json`
- **Next.js configuration** - Verify webpack aliases are properly configured

## Monitoring

The build process now includes comprehensive logging and error handling:

- Version checks before build
- Environment preparation steps
- Build execution monitoring
- Output verification
- Fallback build attempts

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues:

1. **Pin React versions** - Use exact versions, not ranges
2. **Regular dependency audits** - Check for version conflicts
3. **Build environment isolation** - Use consistent Node.js and npm versions
4. **Version enforcement** - Maintain strict version controls

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added overrides, scripts, and version enforcement
- `next.config.js` - Enhanced with React version enforcement
- `.npmrc` - Added dependency resolution settings
- `netlify.toml` - Updated build command and environment variables
- `scripts/` - Added comprehensive build and version management scripts

## Testing

Run the following commands to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test React versions
npm run test:react-versions

# Test export process
npm run export

# Test Netlify build
npm run netlify:build
```

All tests should pass without React version conflicts.
