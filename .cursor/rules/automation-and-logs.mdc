# Automation and Log-Driven Remediation

- Always scan project logs in `automation/logs/` and CI logs.
- If errors recur, create or enhance scripts and cron jobs to detect and fix them automatically.
- Automations should be self-contained and runnable without Cursor or IDE involvement (cron-friendly).
- You may use this computer's terminal, Google Chrome, and install required software/tools when needed.

## Implementation Guidance
- Add Node or Bash scripts under `automation/` or `scripts/`.
- Ensure idempotency and write logs to `automation/logs/`.
- Provide npm scripts (e.g., `logs:monitor`, `cron:install`) for easy operation.
- Prefer non-interactive flags; avoid requiring user input.
