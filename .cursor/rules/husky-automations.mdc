## Husky & Automation Guidelines

- Keep `.husky/` hooks minimal, fast, and deterministic
- Enforce Conventional Commits via `commitlint` in `commit-msg`
- Run `lint-staged` in `pre-commit` to auto-fix staged files
- Prefer type-check in `pre-commit` for safety; keep `pre-push` lean
- Ensure `package.json` has `prepare: husky install`
- Maintain CI equivalents (ESLint, type-check, build, and commitlint)
- Provide a `scripts/husky-health-check.sh` to verify and auto-heal common issues
- Provide a cron wrapper `automation/husky-health-cron.sh` to run checks periodically outside Cursor
- Hooks and scripts must be non-interactive and fail clearly
