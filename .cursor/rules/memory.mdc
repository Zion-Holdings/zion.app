# AI Memory Rule

This rule defines how the assistant manages and utilizes project memory: user preferences, learned facts, and project-specific conventions.

## Storage
- Store persistent knowledge in `.cursor/rules/learned-memories.mdc`
- Keep entries concise and factual; avoid duplications

## Update Protocol
1. Identify new durable knowledge (decision, convention, preference)
2. Check if it exists or conflicts in `learned-memories.mdc`
3. Append or update the relevant section with a short bullet entry

## Usage Protocol
- Before planning or large edits, review `learned-memories.mdc`
- Align suggestions with stored decisions and conventions
