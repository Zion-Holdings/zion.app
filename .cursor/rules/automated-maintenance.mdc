# Automated Maintenance and Continuous Improvement

This rule instructs the assistant to keep the project healthy automatically using built-in scripts and CI.

## Objectives
- Keep dependencies up to date without breaking changes
- Maintain clean linting and type-check state
- Continuously improve code quality and UI/UX

## Protocol
1. Before large edits, run a health check:
   - `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check`
   - `npm run build`
2. For dependency updates, prefer incremental changes and run:
   - `npm run deps:maintain` (project-specific orchestrator)
3. Use the provided workflows to schedule recurring improvement tasks:
   - CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Dependency maintenance: `.github/workflows/dependency-maintenance.yml`
   - Infinite improvement loop: `.github/workflows/infinite-improvement-loop.yml`
4. After fixes, re-run health checks and commit with conventional messages.

## Guardrails
- Avoid mass refactors without tests or build passing
- Respect existing TypeScript and Next.js versions unless explicitly upgrading with a plan
