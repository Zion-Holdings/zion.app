# Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and decisions that should persist across sessions.

## User Preferences
- 

## Technical Decisions
- Node.js >= 20.18.1 (from package.json engines)
- Next.js present (see `next.config.js`)
- TailwindCSS present (see `tailwind.config.js`)

## Project Conventions
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, perf, test)
- Functional React components with TypeScript types

## Known Constraints
- React 17 compatibility

- Always improve commit, push, and sync automation across all computers using Cursor. Create and maintain independent scripts and cron jobs (not tied to Cursor) that frequently auto-commit, rebase/pull, and push to avoid accumulating unsynced changes. Ensure resilience, locking, and fast execution.
