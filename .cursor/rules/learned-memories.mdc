# Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and decisions that should persist across sessions.

## User Preferences
- Always maintain an infinite improvement loop for automations
- Create scripts, cron jobs, and automations that run independent of Cursor
- Use local machine capabilities (terminal, Chrome) when helpful; install required software as needed

## Technical Decisions
- Node.js >= 20.18.1 (from package.json engines)
- Next.js present (see `next.config.js`)
- TailwindCSS present (see `tailwind.config.js`)
- Main branch is the default integration target; prefer direct commits when safe and approved by CI

## Project Conventions
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, perf, test)
- Functional React components with TypeScript types
- Automations should be idempotent, safe to re-run, and log to `automation/logs`

## Known Constraints
- React 17 compatibility
- TailwindCSS configured
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Next.js config present
- TypeScript active with tsconfig.json

- Always improve commit, push, and sync automation across all computers using Cursor. Create and maintain independent scripts and cron jobs (not tied to Cursor) that frequently auto-commit, rebase/pull, and push to avoid accumulating unsynced changes. Ensure resilience, locking, and fast execution.
=======

- Next.js config present

- TypeScript active with tsconfig.json

- Always start, test, follow, and fix the automation scripts

- Create new scripts to automate recurring workflows

- Prefer schedulers (cron/systemd/node-cron) that run independent of Cursor

- Use local tools and install required software responsibly to support automation
