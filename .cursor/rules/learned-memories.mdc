# Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and decisions that should persist across sessions.

## User Preferences
- Always improve Husky automations; ensure hooks run reliably and are kept up-to-date

## Technical Decisions
- Node.js >= 20.18.1 (from package.json engines)
- Next.js present (see `next.config.js`)
- TailwindCSS present (see `tailwind.config.js`)

## Project Conventions
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, perf, test)
- Functional React components with TypeScript types
- Maintain automations that run independently of Cursor via cron scripts and GitHub Actions

## Known Constraints
- React 17 compatibility
- TailwindCSS configured

- Next.js config present

- TypeScript active with tsconfig.json
