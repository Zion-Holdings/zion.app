# Netlify Build Guardrail

- Continuously monitor Netlify deploy status; treat states `error`, `failed`, `canceled` as actionable failures.
- On failure, run local fixers: `npm run fix:all`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`.
- If changes are generated, create an automated PR with clear title `fix(netlify): ...` and trigger a Netlify rebuild via API.
- For trivial fixes (format-only or regenerated files), allow direct commit to `main` when CI is green.
- Secrets required: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` available in CI or environment.
- Local continuous monitoring available via `automation/netlify-monitor-cron.sh` with configurable `INTERVAL`.
