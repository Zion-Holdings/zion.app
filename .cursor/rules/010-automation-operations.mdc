# Automation Operations

- Always start, test, follow, and fix the automation scripts.
- Create new scripts to automate recurring workflows.
- Prefer schedulers (cron/systemd/node-cron) that run independent of Cursor.
- Use this computer's tools as needed (terminal, Chrome) and install required software responsibly.
- After changes, run build/lint checks and synchronize via git.
