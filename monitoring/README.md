# Monitoring Service

This directory contains a Node.js service dedicated to monitoring URL performance and health for the Zion platform.

## Overview

The service likely periodically checks a list of specified URLs, measures response times, checks for availability, and logs this information. It might also integrate with alerting systems if issues are detected.

## Core Technologies (Assumed)

- Node.js
- TypeScript (likely, if consistent with other Node.js services in the project)
- Common HTTP client libraries (e.g., Axios, node-fetch/got) for making requests.
- Potentially a scheduling library (e.g., `node-cron`) if it runs its own checks, or it might be triggered by external cron jobs (like GitHub Actions).

**TODO:** Verify the exact technologies and libraries used by inspecting `monitoring/package.json` (if it exists) or relevant scripts.

## Key Features (Inferred)

- URL health checking (status codes).
- Response time measurement.
- Logging of monitoring data (to console, files, or a database).
- **TODO:** Determine if it has alerting capabilities (e.g., integration with Slack, PagerDuty, Sentry).
- **TODO:** Identify how the list of URLs to monitor is configured.

## Setup and Local Development

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (refer to project's Node version).
    *   npm or yarn.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Navigate to this `monitoring/` directory.
    *   If it has its own `package.json`:
        ```bash
        cd monitoring
        npm install
        ```
    *   If dependencies are managed in the root `package.json`, they should already be installed.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   This service might require environment variables for:
        *   Target URLs or a path to a configuration file listing them.
        *   API keys for alerting services.
        *   Logging configurations.
    *   Check for a `.env.example` in this directory.

4.  **Running the Service:**
    *   There might be an npm script in `monitoring/package.json` or the root `package.json`.
    *   Example:
        ```bash
        npm run start:monitoring
        # or
        node monitoring/index.js # (or whatever the entry point is)
        ```

## Running Tests

-   **TODO:** Add instructions on how to run tests specific to this monitoring service.

## Deployment

-   **TODO:** Document how this service is deployed. Is it containerized? Does it run as a cron job on a server or as part of a CI/CD scheduled task (like the GitHub Actions `hourly-check.yml`)?

## Integration with Other Systems

-   **TODO:** Describe how this monitoring service's findings are used. Are reports generated? Are alerts sent to a central system?
