## Merge Strategy Used

### Conflict Resolution Approach
1. **Primary Strategy**: Recursive merge with `-X theirs` (accept incoming changes)
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Recursive merge with `-X ours` (keep current changes)
3. **Final Fallback**: Cherry-pick individual commits

### Branch Filtering Criteria
- **Include**: `cursor/*` and `codex/*` branches
- **Exclude**: Backup, temporary, test, merge, and systematic branches
- **Age Filter**: Skip branches older than 6 months
- **Commit Count**: Skip branches with more than 50 commits

## Current Progress

### Batch Processing
- **Batch Size**: 5 branches per batch
- **Max Conflicts per Batch**: 2
- **Current Batch**: 1 (in progress)

### Files Modified in Current Merge Branch
- Enhanced routing and navigation
- New product pages and components
- Improved error handling and boundaries
- Better logging and diagnostics
- Enhanced API error surfaces
- Updated configurations and dependencies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Continue Merging**: Process the next batch of branches
2. **Monitor Conflicts**: Resolve any new merge conflicts
3. **Commit Progress**: Save progress after each successful batch

### Long-term Process
1. **Systematic Processing**: Continue with the remaining ~2,280 branches
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts as they arise
3. **Quality Assurance**: Test merged functionality
4. **Final Integration**: Merge to main branch when complete

## Commands for Continuing

### Continue Current Merge Process
```bash
# Stay on current merge branch
git checkout comprehensive-merge-20250823-225350

# Continue with next batch manually
git merge origin/[next-branch-name] --no-edit --strategy=recursive -X theirs

# Or run the continuation script
./continue_merge.sh
```

### Check Progress
```bash
# View merge history
git log --oneline -10

# Check current status
git status

# View unmerged branches
git branch -r --no-merged origin/main | grep -E "(cursor|codex)" | wc -l
```

### Resolve Conflicts
```bash
# View conflicts
git status

# Resolve specific file conflicts
git checkout --theirs [filename]  # Accept incoming changes
git checkout --ours [filename]    # Keep current changes

# Add resolved files
git add [filename]

# Commit merge
git commit -m "Merge [branch-name] - resolved conflicts"
```

## Estimated Timeline

### Processing Speed
- **Current Rate**: ~4 branches per hour (with conflict resolution)
- **Total Branches**: 2,284
- **Estimated Time**: 570+ hours (23+ days) for complete processing

### Recommendations
1. **Automated Processing**: Run merge scripts during off-hours
2. **Batch Commits**: Commit progress after each successful batch
3. **Conflict Monitoring**: Address complex conflicts manually
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor logs and progress files
