# Immediate Recovery Actions (Next 24 Hours)

## Current Status Summary
- **25 valid workflows** are working and should be preserved
- **167 invalid workflows** need systematic recovery
- **Automated fixes failed** due to structural complexity
- **Manual recovery approach** required for critical workflows

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Next 4 hours)

### 1.1 Backup Working Workflows
```bash
# Create backup of all working workflows
mkdir -p workflow_backups/working
cp .github/workflows/*.yml workflow_backups/working/

# Validate backup integrity
python3 -c "
import yaml
import os
from pathlib import Path

backup_dir = Path('workflow_backups/working')
valid_count = 0
total_count = 0

for yaml_file in backup_dir.glob('*.yml'):
    total_count += 1
    try:
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
            yaml.safe_load(f)
        valid_count += 1
    except:
        pass

print(f'Backup validation: {valid_count}/{total_count} files valid')
"
```

### 1.2 Identify Critical Workflows
Priority order for immediate recovery:
1. `ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
2. `deploy.yml` - Deployment automation  
3. `test.yml` - Testing automation
4. `security-scan.yml` - Security checks
5. `dependency-management.yml` - Dependency updates

### 1.3 Create Workflow Template Library
```bash
# Create template directory
mkdir -p workflow_templates

# Copy working workflows as templates
cp workflow_backups/working/*.yml workflow_templates/
```

## Phase 2: Critical Workflow Recovery (Next 8 hours)

### 2.1 Fix `ci.yml` (Main CI Pipeline)
**Current status**: Invalid - mapping values not allowed
**Priority**: Critical - affects all CI/CD operations

**Recovery approach**:
1. Examine the broken file structure
2. Use working workflow patterns as reference
3. Recreate with minimal, functional structure
4. Validate YAML syntax
5. Test basic functionality

### 2.2 Fix `deploy.yml` (Deployment Automation)
**Current status**: Invalid - mapping values not allowed
**Priority**: Critical - affects production deployments

**Recovery approach**:
1. Identify deployment requirements
2. Create minimal deployment workflow
3. Ensure proper environment handling
4. Validate and test deployment logic

### 2.3 Fix `test.yml` (Testing Automation)
**Current status**: Invalid - mapping values not allowed
**Priority**: Critical - affects code quality

**Recovery approach**:
1. Define testing requirements
2. Create comprehensive test workflow
3. Include multiple test types (unit, integration, e2e)
4. Validate test execution

## Phase 3: Validation and Testing (Next 4 hours)

### 3.1 YAML Syntax Validation
```bash
# Validate all recovered workflows
python3 -c "
import yaml
import os
from pathlib import Path

workflows_dir = Path('.github/workflows')
invalid_files = []
valid_files = []

for yaml_file in workflows_dir.glob('*.yml'):
    try:
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
            yaml.safe_load(f)
        valid_files.append(str(yaml_file))
    except Exception as e:
        invalid_files.append(str(yaml_file))

print(f'Validation Results:')
print(f'  Valid: {len(valid_files)}')
print(f'  Invalid: {len(invalid_files)}')
print(f'  Health Score: {len(valid_files)}/{len(valid_files) + len(invalid_files)}')
"
```

### 3.2 Workflow Functionality Testing
- Test each recovered workflow individually
- Verify trigger conditions work correctly
- Ensure proper job execution
- Validate artifact handling

### 3.3 Integration Testing
- Test workflow dependencies
- Verify cross-workflow communication
- Check resource usage and limits
- Validate error handling

## Phase 4: Documentation and Planning (Next 8 hours)

### 4.1 Recovery Documentation
- Document recovery procedures used
- Create troubleshooting guides
- Update workflow maintenance procedures
- Create template usage guidelines

### 4.2 Long-term Prevention Plan
- Implement pre-commit YAML validation
- Create workflow health monitoring
- Establish backup and recovery procedures
- Plan automated testing improvements

## Success Criteria for Day 1

### Minimum Viable Recovery
- **5 critical workflows** fully functional
- **YAML validation** passing for all recovered workflows
- **Basic CI/CD pipeline** operational
- **Deployment automation** working
- **Testing automation** functional

### Quality Standards
- All recovered workflows pass YAML validation
- Critical workflows execute successfully
- No regression in existing functionality
- Documentation updated and accessible

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- Maintain git backups of all changes
- Create workflow snapshots before major changes
- Document all recovery actions taken
- Preserve working workflow templates

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original broken files as reference
- Maintain git history for all changes
- Create recovery checkpoints
- Document rollback procedures

### Testing Strategy
- Test workflows in isolation first
- Validate integration points carefully
- Monitor system performance during recovery
- Have fallback options ready

## Next Day Priorities

### Immediate (Day 2)
1. Continue critical workflow recovery
2. Implement automated validation
3. Create workflow health monitoring
4. Begin medium-priority workflow recovery

### This Week
1. Recover 20-30 additional workflows
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Create maintenance procedures
4. Plan long-term improvements

## Resource Requirements

### Time Allocation
- **Day 1**: 16 hours (full day)
- **Day 2**: 8-12 hours
- **This week**: 4-8 hours per day
- **Ongoing**: 2-4 hours per week

### Skills Required
- YAML syntax and GitHub Actions expertise
- CI/CD pipeline understanding
- Testing and validation experience
- Documentation and process improvement

### Tools and Infrastructure
- GitHub repository access
- Local development environment
- YAML validation tools
- Testing and monitoring capabilities

## Conclusion

The immediate recovery actions focus on restoring critical CI/CD functionality while establishing a foundation for systematic recovery of all workflows. Success depends on careful execution, thorough testing, and maintaining system stability throughout the process.

**Key success factors**:
1. Prioritize critical workflows first
2. Maintain working state throughout recovery
3. Test thoroughly before proceeding
4. Document all actions and procedures
5. Plan for long-term prevention

**Expected outcome**: Functional CI/CD pipeline with 5+ critical workflows operational by end of day 1.
