# ZionGPT Fine-Tuning Workflow

This document outlines the process for building and deploying a private fine-tuned GPT model named **ZionGPT**. The goal is to leverage internal datasets (job posts, talent profiles and support logs) to power job description generation, talent recommendations and a support chatbot that matches Zion's tone.

## 1. Data Ingestion

1. **Pull anonymized records** from the following tables via Supabase:
   - `job_posts`
   - `resumes`
   - `support_logs`
2. Strip personally identifiable information (PII) before use. The training
   script now automatically removes emails, phone numbers and simple names.
3. Convert each record to **prompt → completion** pairs as used by the OpenAI fine-tuning API.
4. Save the dataset to `training-data.jsonl`. The helper script `scripts/zion-gpt-train.js` performs these steps.

## 2. Fine-Tuning Setup

1. Ensure the environment variables `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are configured.
2. Run the training script:

   ```sh
   node scripts/zion-gpt-train.js
   ```

3. The script uploads the dataset and creates a fine-tuning job targeting the `gpt-3.5-turbo` base model. Once complete, note the resulting model ID (e.g. `zion-job-generator-v1`).

## 3. Operator Management

- Track training jobs and versions in a `model_versions` table or a similar log.
- Update application configuration to reference the latest model (e.g. `zion-job-generator-v2`).
- Monitor for errors or token spikes via Supabase logging.

## 4. Live Deployment

- Route features such as the resume builder, job description generator and proposal tools to use the newest ZionGPT model.
- A/B test output quality against the base GPT model to verify improvements.

## 5. Optional Evaluation Dashboard

- Create an internal dashboard that compares ZionGPT outputs to base GPT, measuring accuracy and tone compliance.

## 6. Privacy Considerations

- Always remove PII before sending data to the training script. The helper
  script now strips emails, phone numbers and basic name patterns before
  uploading.
- Offer users a training opt‑out setting in the application so their content is skipped during dataset generation.
