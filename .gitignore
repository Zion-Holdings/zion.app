# Prevent compiled JS files from being committed when TS/TSX source exists
# These should be generated at build time, not committed
pages/**/*.js
pages/**/*.d.ts

# Prevent JSX/TSX conflicts - prefer TSX for consistency
pages/**/*.jsx

# Exception: Allow standalone JS files that don't have TS counterparts
# (This will need manual management if needed)
