## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours)
- Investigate database backup workflow failures
- Review image optimization workflow resource allocation
- Implement retry logic for email campaign workflows

### Short-term Improvements (Next week)
- Consolidate similar workflows to reduce overhead
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- Add comprehensive logging for failed workflows

### Long-term Optimizations (Next month)
- Review scheduling frequencies and optimize timing
- Implement workflow dependency management
- Establish performance baselines and alerting

## Monitoring & Alerting
- **Critical alerts**: Workflow failure rate > 10%
- **Warning alerts**: Workflow execution time > 2x average
- **Info alerts**: New workflow deployments
