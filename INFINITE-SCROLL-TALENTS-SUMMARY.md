## Technical Implementation

### Talent Generation Algorithm

```typescript
- Specialization-based generation with popularity weights
- Experience: 2-12 years based on category
- Hourly Rates: Market-realistic ranges by specialization
- Skills: Category-specific skill sets (5-8 skills per talent)
- Verification: 70% verification rate
- Ratings: 3.5-5.0 with experience correlation
```

### Market Rate Ranges by Specialization

- **AI/ML Engineering**: $120-220/hr (~$19k-35k/month)
- **Software Development**: $80-180/hr (~$13k-29k/month)
- **Data Science**: $90-170/hr (~$14k-27k/month)
- **Cybersecurity**: $100-190/hr (~$16k-30k/month)
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: $95-185/hr (~$15k-30k/month)

### Filtering & Recommendation Logic

- **Experience Factor**: Higher experience = higher rates
- **Market Variation**: ±15% realistic pricing variation
- **Rating Correlation**: Experience and reasonable rates = better ratings
- **Recommendation Score**: 40% rating + 30% experience + 30% verification
