# Points Dashboard & Rewards Upgrade (Issue #14)

## 🔍 Issue Summary
The navbar showed `0 pts` with no explanation or next step. Clicking the badge went to an unfinished page, confusing users about the loyalty program.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented
- Reworked `/points` into a dual experience:
  - **Logged out:** marketing explainer with earning opportunities and CTA to join.
  - **Logged in:** full rewards dashboard showing balance, earning tasks, upcoming rewards, and history.
- Enhanced `PointsBadge` with detailed tooltip text and clear actions.
- Added visual progress tracking and responsive layout.

## ✅ Outcome
- Users immediately understand how points work and how to earn them.
- The points page now feels complete and encourages ongoing engagement.
- Issue #14 is fully resolved with a professional rewards dashboard.

## ℹ️ Points & Rewards Explained
The dashboard clearly displays your balance. If you see **`0 pts`**, it simply
means you haven't earned any rewards yet. Earn points by signing up, making
purchases, posting in the community, and inviting friends. Your balance grows
with each action. Soon you'll be able to redeem points for coupons, premium
features, and exclusive swag. By showing upcoming rewards and your progress, the
dashboard motivates you to keep participating and unlock new perks.
