## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Points & Rewards Explained

The dashboard clearly displays your balance. If you see **`0 pts`**, it simply
means you haven't earned any rewards yet. Earn points by signing up, making
purchases, posting in the community, and inviting friends. Your balance grows
with each action. Soon you'll be able to redeem points for coupons, premium
features, and exclusive swag. By showing upcoming rewards and your progress, the
dashboard motivates you to keep participating and unlock new perks.
