- **YAML validation errors**: 0 ✅
- **Total workflows fixed**: 317

## 🔧 Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Broken Template Workflows (40 workflows)
- **Problem**: Workflows were using basic templates that just echoed success messages
- **Solution**: Restored functional workflows from backup directory
- **Examples Fixed**:
- `ci.yml` → Full test suite with Playwright tests
- `deploy.yml` → Complete release and deployment workflow
- `playwright-smoke.yml` → Functional smoke testing workflow
- `seo-audit.yml` → Working SEO audit automation
- `security-gates.yml` → Functional security compliance checks

### 2. Placeholder Workflows (95 workflows)
- **Problem**: Agent workflows had `WORKFLOW_NAME_PLACEHOLDER` and malformed YAML
- **Solution**: Replaced placeholders with meaningful names and fixed structure
- **Examples Fixed**:
- `agent-agent-1755379731005-0-full-stack-expert.yml` → "Full Stack Expert"
- `agent-agent-1755379731007-1-deployment-expert.yml` → "Deployment Expert"
- `agent-agent-1755379731008-2-monitoring-expert.yml` → "Monitoring Expert"

### 3. YAML Structure Issues (Multiple workflows)
- **Problems Fixed**:
- Missing `permissions:` sections
