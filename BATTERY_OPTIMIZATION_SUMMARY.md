# ðŸ”‹ Battery Optimization Summary

This update introduces a small energyâ€‘saving enhancement to the Zion app.

## âœ… Key Improvement

- **Service Worker Registration**: The function now checks `navigator.connection.saveData` before registering the service worker. When users enable the browser's data saver modeâ€”which is often used to conserve batteryâ€”the app will skip service worker registration. This avoids background processes such as caching and sync that can drain power.
  - **File**: `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.ts`

## ðŸŒŸ Benefits

- Reduces background activity for users who opt into data saving.
- Respects user preference for lower power consumption.
