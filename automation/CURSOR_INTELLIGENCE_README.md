# üß† Cursor Intelligence System

A comprehensive intelligent system that creates a snowball effect of intelligence amplification for Cursor agents, enabling them to become more intelligent through collaboration, knowledge synthesis, and continuous learning.

## üåü Overview

The Cursor Intelligence System is designed to create an intelligent feedback loop between Cursor agents and project automation, creating a snowball effect where:

1. **Agents become more intelligent** through enhanced context and prompts
2. **Collaboration improves** as agents learn from each other
3. **Knowledge accumulates** and gets synthesized into reusable patterns
4. **Intelligence grows exponentially** as the system learns from every interaction
