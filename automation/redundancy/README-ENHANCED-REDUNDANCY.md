## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# PM2 Configuration
AUTO_SYNC_REMOTE=origin
AUTO_SYNC_BRANCH=main
AUTO_SYNC_STRATEGY=hardreset
AUTO_SYNC_CLEAN=1
AUTO_SYNC_GC=0

# GitHub Configuration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token  # For workflow triggering

# Netlify Configuration

```

### Customization Options

Each manager can be customized for specific needs:

```javascript
// Example: Custom PM2 manager configuration
const manager = new EnhancedPM2RedundancyManager();
manager.maxRestarts = 25;  // Increase max restarts
manager.healthCheckInterval = 300000;  // 5 minutes
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Access Control

- **Process Isolation**: Each manager runs independently
- **File Permissions**: Appropriate permissions for logs and reports
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Minimal external network access

### Best Practices

- Keep environment variables secure
- Regularly rotate access tokens
- Monitor log files for suspicious activity
- Use least privilege principle for permissions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PM2 Process Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check PM2 status
   pm2 status
   
   # Restart specific process
   pm2 restart zion-auto-sync-enhanced-backup
   ```

2. **GitHub Workflow Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check workflow health
   node enhanced-github-actions-redundancy-manager.cjs health
   
   # Recreate backup workflows
   node enhanced-github-actions-redundancy-manager.cjs start
   ```

3. **Netlify Function Problems**
   ```bash
   # Test functions
   node enhanced-netlify-functions-redundancy-manager.cjs health
   
   # Redeploy functions
   node enhanced-netlify-functions-redundancy-manager.cjs start
   ```

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Force Stop All**
   ```bash
   ./stop-enhanced-redundancy-system.sh --force
   ```

2. **Emergency Recovery**
   ```bash
   node enhanced-master-redundancy-orchestrator.cjs emergency
   ```

3. **Clean Restart**
   ```bash
   ./stop-enhanced-redundancy-system.sh
   ./start-enhanced-redundancy-system.sh
   ```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: ~50-150MB per manager process
- **CPU**: Minimal during idle, spikes during operations
- **Disk**: Log files grow ~2-10MB per day
- **Network**: Minimal for health checks, moderate for deployments

### Optimization

- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log management
- **Health Check Throttling**: Configurable intervals
- **Process Pooling**: Efficient process management
- **Error Rate Limiting**: Prevents cascade failures

## 🔄 Integration

### With Existing Systems

The enhanced redundancy system is designed to work alongside existing automation:

- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't modify existing processes
- **Parallel Operation**: Runs independently of primary systems
- **Failover Ready**: Automatically takes over when needed
- **Graceful Handoff**: Returns control when primary systems recover

### Customization

Each manager can be customized for specific environments:

```javascript
// Example: Custom health check intervals
const orchestrator = new EnhancedMasterRedundancyOrchestrator();
orchestrator.healthCheckInterval = 60000;  // 1 minute
orchestrator.recoveryInterval = 300000;    // 5 minutes
```
