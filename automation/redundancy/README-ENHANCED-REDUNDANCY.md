## 📊 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Schedule
- **Individual Managers**: Every 3-15 minutes
- **System Health**: Every 30 minutes
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Every 2 hours
- **Recovery Attempts**: Every 5-10 minutes

### Health Indicators
- **Healthy**: Component operating normally (90%+ success rate)
- **Degraded**: Component has issues but recovery is possible (70-89% success rate)
- **Unhealthy**: Component has significant issues (50-69% success rate)
- **Critical**: Component has failed and needs immediate attention (<50% success rate)

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Automatic Recovery**: Up to 5 attempts per component
2. **Manager Restart**: Failed managers are automatically restarted
3. **Emergency Recovery**: Full system restart when health < 50%
4. **Process Resurrection**: PM2 processes are resurrected if needed

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~100-200MB per manager process
- **CPU**: Minimal during idle, spikes during operations
- **Disk**: Log files grow ~5-10MB per day
- **Network**: Minimal for health checks, moderate for deployments

### Optimization
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are automatically managed
- **Health Check Throttling**: Configurable intervals
- **Process Pooling**: Efficient process management
- **Error Rate Limiting**: Prevents cascade failures

## 🔒 Security

### Access Control
- **Process Isolation**: Each manager runs independently
- **File Permissions**: Logs and reports use appropriate permissions
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment
- **Network Security**: Minimal external network access

### Best Practices
- Keep environment variables secure
- Regularly rotate access tokens
- Monitor log files for suspicious activity
- Use least privilege principle for permissions

## 🔄 Integration

### With Existing Systems
The enhanced redundancy system is designed to work alongside existing automation:

- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't modify existing processes
- **Parallel Operation**: Runs independently of primary systems
- **Failover Ready**: Automatically takes over when needed
- **Graceful Handoff**: Returns control when primary systems recover

### Customization
Each manager can be customized:

```javascript
// Example: Custom PM2 manager configuration
const manager = new EnhancedPM2RedundancyManager();
manager.maxRecoveryAttempts = 10;
manager.healthCheckInterval = 300000; // 5 minutes
```

## 📚 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- **Daily**: Check system status and logs
- **Weekly**: Review comprehensive reports
- **Monthly**: Performance review and optimization
- **Quarterly**: Update backup strategies

### Updates
- **Automatic**: System updates itself when possible
- **Manual**: Critical updates require manual intervention
- **Rollback**: Previous versions can be restored

### Monitoring
- **Real-time**: Live status monitoring
- **Historical**: Trend analysis and reporting
- **Alerts**: Automatic notification of issues
