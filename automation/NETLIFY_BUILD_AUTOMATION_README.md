## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- Netlify account with API access
- Environment variables configured

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env.netlify` file in your project root:

```bash
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_site_id_here
NETLIFY_SITE_NAME=your_site_name_here
NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK=your_build_hook_url_here
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. **Fix Build Issues**
```bash
# Run full optimization and fix common issues
npm run netlify:optimize

# Or run specific commands
node automation/netlify-build-optimizer.cjs analyze
node automation/netlify-build-optimizer.cjs fix
node automation/netlify-build-optimizer.cjs optimize
```

#### 2. **Collect Build Analytics**
```bash
# Run full analytics analysis
npm run netlify:analytics

# Or run specific commands
node automation/netlify-build-analytics.cjs collect
node automation/netlify-build-analytics.cjs analyze
node automation/netlify-build-analytics.cjs report
```

#### 3. **Run Intelligent Build**
```bash
# Run full intelligent build cycle
npm run netlify:intelligent

# Or run specific commands
node automation/netlify-intelligent-build-orchestrator.cjs health
node automation/netlify-intelligent-build-orchestrator.cjs build
node automation/netlify-intelligent-build-orchestrator.cjs report
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Automated Scheduling
The system integrates with Netlify's scheduled functions for continuous automation:

```toml
# In netlify.toml
[[scheduled.functions]]
  name = "netlify-auto-healer-runner"
  schedule = "*/20 * * * *" # every 20 minutes

[[scheduled.functions]]
  name = "netlify-build-optimizer-runner"
  schedule = "0 */6 * * *" # every 6 hours
```

### Custom Build Scripts
The system creates optimized build scripts automatically:

```bash
# Use the optimized build script
./automation/build-optimized.sh

# Or run via npm
npm run build:optimized
```

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Log Files
All automation systems generate detailed logs:
- `automation/logs/netlify-build-optimizer.log`
- `automation/logs/netlify-build-analytics.log`
- `automation/logs/netlify-intelligent-build-orchestrator.log`

### Analytics Reports
Comprehensive reports are generated in:
- `automation/analytics/build-analytics-*.json`
- `automation/logs/build-optimization-*.json`
- `automation/logs/intelligence-report-*.json`

### Health Dashboard
Monitor system health with:
```bash
npm run netlify:intelligent health
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Build Export Conflicts**
```bash
# The system automatically detects and fixes:
# - Directory cleanup issues
# - Reports folder conflicts
# - Stale build artifacts
npm run netlify:optimize
```

#### 2. **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Automatic memory optimization:
# - Sets NODE_OPTIONS with --max-old-space-size
# - Configures optimal memory settings
# - Updates environment variables
```

#### 3. **Dependency Problems**
```bash
# Automatic dependency health checks:
# - Outdated package detection
# - Security vulnerability scanning
# - Package size optimization
npm run netlify:analytics
```

### Manual Fixes

#### Clean Build Environment
```bash
# Remove all build artifacts
rm -rf .next out tsconfig.tsbuildinfo .temp

# Clean npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### Reset Automation State
```bash
# Clear automation logs
rm -rf automation/logs/*.log

# Reset build history
rm -rf automation/logs/build-history.json
rm -rf automation/analytics/build-history.json
```

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
The system works seamlessly with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/netlify-automation.yml
name: Netlify Automation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *' # every 6 hours

jobs:
  automation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run netlify:optimize
      - run: npm run netlify:analytics
      - run: npm run netlify:intelligent
```

### Netlify Build Hooks
