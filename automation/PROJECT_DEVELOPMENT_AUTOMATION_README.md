# Project Development Automation System

## Overview

The Project Development Automation System is a comprehensive autonomous system designed to continuously develop and improve the project based on chat conversation analysis and Google doc requirements.

## System Components

### 1. Project Development Autonomous Factory (`project-development-autonomous-factory.js`)

- **Purpose**: Central orchestrator for project development automation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Creates and manages specialized development agents
  - Coordinates continuous development processes
  - Monitors system performance and health
  - Implements automated improvements
  - Manages deployment and monitoring

### 2. Deep Analysis Agent (`project-development-agents/deep-analysis-agent.js`)

- **Purpose**: Performs deep analysis of chat conversation and project comparison
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes chat conversation requirements
  - Compares with current project state
  - Identifies gaps and opportunities
  - Generates improvement recommendations
  - Creates comprehensive reports

### 3. Specialized Development Agents

- **Project Analyzer**: Deep analysis of requirements and current state
- **Content Developer**: Creates and optimizes content
- **Feature Implementer**: Implements new features and improvements
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures quality and performance standards
- **Deployment Manager**: Manages deployment and monitoring

### 4. Cron Job Management (`cron-jobs/project-development-automation-cron.sh`)

- **Purpose**: Orchestrates continuous automation processes
- **Capabilities**:
  - Starts and manages the autonomous factory
  - Monitors agent health and performance
  - Handles backup and cleanup operations
  - Generates status reports

## Usage

### Starting the System

```bash
./start-project-development-automation.sh
```

### Stopping the System

```bash
./stop-project-development-automation.sh
```

### Checking Status

```bash
./status-project-development-automation.sh
```

### Manual Agent Execution

```bash

# Start deep analysis agent
node project-development-agents/deep-analysis-agent.js

# Start factory
node project-development-autonomous-factory.js
```

## Configuration

The system is configured via `project-development-config.json`:

```json
{
  "projectUrl": "https://ziontechgroup.netlify.app",
  "chatAnalysisUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/share/688b6030-1aa0-800b-9b63-ec9a269ea62d",
  "googleDocUrl": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q3-QbWjIIj83VYX_Hx258kmvEyF9qBR2nF09IOi4ppM/edit?usp=sharing",
  "agents": {
    "project-analyzer": {
      "schedule": "*/10 * * * *",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }
}
```
