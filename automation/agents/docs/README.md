## ðŸ“Š Agent Statistics

- **Total Agents**: 7
- **Agent Types**: frontend, testing, backend, optimization, deployment, full-stack
- **Complexity Levels**: expert, intermediate

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Agents are automatically generated based on application needs
2. Each agent has its own workflow in `.github/workflows/`
3. Agents run every 6 hours or can be triggered manually
4. Check agent logs for execution details

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The factory configuration is stored in `automation/config/factory-config.json`
