   - Backup and recovery operations
   - Performance optimization tasks

### Monitoring Agents

1. **System Health Monitor**: Continuous health monitoring
2. **Error Detection Agent**: Error detection and identification
3. **Performance Optimizer**: Performance analysis and optimization
4. **Maintenance Scheduler**: Maintenance planning and scheduling
5. **Recovery Agent**: Error recovery and system restart
6. **Backup Manager**: Backup creation and management
7. **Cleanup Agent**: System cleanup and maintenance
8. **Report Generator**: Report creation and analysis

## Usage

### Starting the System

```bash
# Start the system
./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh start

# Or use the launcher directly
node launch-automation-monitor-and-maintainer.js start
```

### Stopping the System

```bash
# Stop the system
./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh stop

# Or use the launcher directly
node launch-automation-monitor-and-maintainer.js stop
```

### Checking Status

```bash
# Check system status
./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh status

# Or use the launcher directly
node launch-automation-monitor-and-maintainer.js status
```

### Health Check

```bash
# Perform health check
./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh health

# Or use the launcher directly
node launch-automation-monitor-and-maintainer.js health
```

### Generate Report

```bash
# Generate system report
./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh report

# Or use the launcher directly
node launch-automation-monitor-and-maintainer.js report
```

## Configuration

The system is configured via `automation-monitor-config.json`:

```json
{
    "healthCheckInterval": "*/2 * * * *",
    "errorThreshold": 3,
    "performanceThreshold": 0.8,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "backupInterval": "0 */6 * * *",
    "cleanupInterval": "0 2 * * *",
    "reportInterval": "0 */1 * * *"
}
```

## Monitoring

### Health Metrics

- System uptime and status
- Error rates and types
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Response times

### Reports

- Comprehensive system reports
- Health check reports
- Performance analysis
- Error analysis and recommendations
- Maintenance schedules

### Logs

- System logs in `logs/` directory
- Error logs in `error-logs/` directory
- Health reports in `health-reports/` directory
- Maintenance logs in `maintenance-logs/` directory

## Maintenance

### Automatic Maintenance

- Daily cleanup operations
- Weekly backup creation
- Monthly performance optimization
- Quarterly system health review

### Manual Maintenance

- System restart: `./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh restart`
- Backup creation: `./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh backup`
- Cleanup operations: `./cron-jobs/automation-monitor-and-maintainer-cron.sh cleanup`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **System not starting**: Check Node.js installation and dependencies
2. **Health check failures**: Verify system permissions and file access
3. **Performance issues**: Check system resources and configuration
4. **Error recovery failures**: Review error logs and system status

### Debugging

- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Review error logs in `error-logs/` directory
- Examine health reports in `health-reports/` directory
- Use status command for current system state

## Security

- All scripts run with user permissions
- No root access required
- Secure file permissions
- Encrypted configuration storage (optional)

## Support

For issues and questions:

1. Check the logs and reports
2. Review the configuration
3. Test individual components
4. Restart the system if needed
