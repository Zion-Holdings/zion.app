## üîß Configuration

### System Configuration

The system can be configured through the `config` object in `start-autonomous-system.js`:

```javascript
{
  orchestrator: {
    enabled: true,
    priority: 'critical',
    autoRestart: true
  },
  factories: {
    responsiveContent: { enabled: true, priority: 'critical' },
    performanceOptimization: { enabled: true, priority: 'critical' },
    // ... more factories
  },
  monitoring: {
    healthCheckInterval: '2m',
    performanceCheckInterval: '5m',
    autoRecovery: true,
    logging: true
  },
  continuousImprovement: {
    enabled: true,
    learningRate: 0.1,
    evolutionEnabled: true
  }
}
```

### Cron Schedules

The system uses various cron schedules for different operations:

- **Content Validation**: Every 5 minutes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Every 2 minutes
- **Security Scanning**: Every hour
- **Backup Automation**: Every 6 hours
- **Analytics Collection**: Every minute
- **Agent Health Monitoring**: Every 10 minutes
- **Factory Improvement**: Every 2 hours

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Agent Types

To add a new agent type, modify the `loadAgentTypes()` method in `responsive-content-agents-factory.js`:

```javascript
this.agentTypes.set('your-new-agent', {
  name: 'Your New Agent',
  description: 'Description of your new agent',
  frequency: '5m',
  priority: 'high'
});
```

### Adding New Factory Types

To add a new factory type, modify the `loadFactoryTypes()` method in `autonomous-automation-orchestrator.js`:

```javascript
this.factoryTypes.set('your-new-factory', {
