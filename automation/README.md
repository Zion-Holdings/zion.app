## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Master Orchestrator Configuration

The master orchestrator configuration is stored in `automation/config/master-orchestrator.json`:

```json
{
  "executionMode": "intelligent",
  "maxConcurrentSystems": 3,
  "healthCheckInterval": 300000,
  "autoRecovery": true,
  "priorities": {
    "critical": ["workflow-health", "dependency-health"],
    "high": ["resource-optimization", "workflow-standardization"],
    "medium": ["smart-dispatch", "retry-system"],
    "low": ["reporting", "cleanup"]
  },
  "schedules": {
    "hourly": ["workflow-health", "smart-dispatch"],
    "daily": ["dependency-health", "resource-optimization"],
    "weekly": ["comprehensive-audit", "cleanup"]
  }
}
```

### System-Specific Configuration

Each automation system has its own configuration file in the `automation/config/` directory:

- `resource-optimization.json` - Resource limits and optimization settings
- `dispatcher-config.json` - Workflow dispatch rules and batching
- `master-orchestrator.json` - Overall system coordination

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Health Reports

All systems generate detailed reports stored in `automation/reports/`:

- `workflow-health-report.json` - Workflow health analysis
- `dependency-health-report.json` - Dependency status and updates
- `workflow-schedule.json` - Resource optimization results
- `workflow-standardization-report.json` - Standardization changes
- `workflow-dispatch-report.json` - Dispatch execution results
- `comprehensive-audit-report.json` - Overall system health

### Health Metrics

The system tracks various health metrics:

- **Workflow Health Score**: 0-100 based on issues and configurations
- **Dependency Health Score**: 0-100 based on vulnerabilities and updates
- **System Status**: Running, Stopped, Error, Unrecoverable
- **Execution Success Rate**: Percentage of successful automation runs
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, and concurrent workflow usage

## üîÑ Continuous Operation

### Continuous Mode

Start the system in continuous mode for ongoing automation:

```bash
# Start continuous mode
const orchestrator = new MasterAutomationOrchestrator();
await orchestrator.startContinuousMode();

# Stop continuous mode
orchestrator.stopContinuousMode();
```

### Scheduled Tasks

The system automatically runs tasks on different schedules:

- **Hourly**: Workflow health checks, smart dispatch
- **Daily**: Dependency health, resource optimization, workflow standardization
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive audits, cleanup operations

### Auto-Recovery

When systems fail, the orchestrator automatically attempts recovery:

1. Stop the failed system
2. Wait for cooldown period
3. Restart the system
4. Verify recovery success

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **System Won't Start**
   - Check Node.js version (requires 20.18.1+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check file permissions

2. **Workflows Not Being Fixed**
   - Ensure GitHub tokens have proper permissions
   - Check workflow file paths
   - Verify GitHub API access

3. **High Resource Usage**
   - Adjust `maxConcurrentSystems` in configuration
   - Review resource optimization settings
   - Check for infinite loops in automation scripts

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=automation:* node automation/master-automation-orchestrator.cjs
```

### Manual Recovery

If auto-recovery fails, manually restart systems:

```bash
# Restart specific system
const orchestrator = new MasterAutomationOrchestrator();
await orchestrator.startAutomationSystem('workflow-health');

# Run comprehensive audit
await orchestrator.runComprehensiveAudit();
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

- **Concurrent Systems**: Limit to 3-5 concurrent automation systems
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor Node.js memory usage, adjust `--max-old-space-size`
- **API Rate Limits**: Respect GitHub API rate limits
- **Workflow Batching**: Group related workflows to reduce overhead

### Caching

- **npm Cache**: Enable npm caching in workflows
- **Dependency Caching**: Cache node_modules between runs
- **Report Caching**: Cache analysis results for quick access

### Scheduling

- **Off-Peak Execution**: Run resource-intensive operations during low-traffic hours
- **Staggered Execution**: Avoid running all systems simultaneously
- **Priority Queuing**: Execute critical systems first

## üîí Security Considerations

### Token Management

- Use GitHub App tokens instead of personal access tokens
- Limit token scopes to minimum required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Store tokens securely (use GitHub Secrets)

### Workflow Security

- Review all automated changes before merging
- Test automation systems in staging environment
- Monitor for unexpected workflow modifications
- Implement approval workflows for critical changes

### Dependency Security

- Enable automatic security updates for critical packages
- Review major version updates before applying
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

    this.priority = 'medium';
  }
  
  async run() {
    // Custom automation logic
  }
}

// Register with master orchestrator
orchestrator.automationSystems.set('custom', {
  name: 'Custom System',
  class: CustomAutomationSystem,
  instance: null,
  status: 'stopped',
  priority: 'medium'
});
```
