# Linting Autonomous Agents System

A comprehensive autonomous system for continuously detecting and fixing linting errors in real-time, operating independently of existing autonomous agents factories.

## üöÄ Overview

The Linting Autonomous Agents System provides multiple layers of automation for maintaining code quality:

1. **Autonomous Agents Factory** - Creates and manages specialized linting agents
2. **Cron Automation** - Scheduled linting checks and fixes
3. **File Watcher** - Real-time file monitoring and automatic fixes
4. **Orchestrator** - Coordinates all linting automation systems
