Title: ZION OS — From Founding to the Global Multiverse (60 minutes)
Route: /zion-film

Logline
A cinematic journey from a sovereign-work hypothesis to a network-state multiverse, following the rise of Zion OS—its people, primitives, and the AI-native governance shaping the next civilization layer.
