1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In an age of platforms, we asked a question that didn’t fit on a login screen.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Work is not a place. It’s a right. It’s a nation in motion.

3
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The first vote was small. The meaning was not.

4
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
A trailer for a world that didn’t exist yet.

5
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Before code spread, a book carried the signal.

6
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We moved by contribution, not credential.

7
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The day work cleared on-chain, belief became balance.

8
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Rituals turned into rules. Rules turned into rails.

9
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We didn’t buy land. We rendered it.

10
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Genesis wasn’t a launch date. It was a vow.

11
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A token is a tool when it funds the commons.

12
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Not one state. A multiverse of them.

13
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We met in time zones instead of borders.

14
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The academy taught skills. The network conferred belonging.

15
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Money moved like water: measured, transparent, replenishing.

16
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Governance is a verb.

17
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We were not users. We were citizens.

18
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Identity wasn’t a form. It was a function of value created.

19
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
When coordination compounds, prosperity does too.

20
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The rise was visible. The reason was invisible: trust.

21
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
We taught the machine our constitution, then asked it to keep us honest.

22
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Proof replaced paperwork.

23
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We lowered the cost of founding from a decade to a weekend.

24
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
A world not of scarcity, but of coordination.

25
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
This isn’t a platform. It’s a world. Build with us.
