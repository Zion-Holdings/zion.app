## Next Steps

1. **Priority Languages**: Focus on languages with < 80% completion
2. **Use Translation Manager**: Visit `/translation-manager` in your app to edit translations
3. **Automated Translation**: Consider using the auto-translate feature for initial translations
4. **Review Translations**: Have native speakers review auto-translated content
5. **Add New Keys**: Ensure new features include translations for all supported languages

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Keys**: Use descriptive, hierarchical keys (e.g., `nav.home`, `errors.page_not_found`)
- **Pluralization**: Use i18next pluralization features for count-based translations
- **Context**: Provide context in key names to help translators
- **Interpolation**: Use variables for dynamic content: `"welcome": "Hello, {{name}}!"`
- **Testing**: Test all languages in different browsers and devices
