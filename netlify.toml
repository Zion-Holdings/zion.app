  # This plugin primarily uses Lighthouse's own audits.
  # Lighthouse itself doesn't have a direct "total JS bundle size" audit in this format.
  # It has "total-byte-weight" which includes all resources, and "unused-javascript".
  # We'll rely on the Lighthouse performance score for now, as direct JS bundle size enforcement
  # might need a separate tool or script if this plugin doesn't cover it.
  # For the purpose of this task, we will focus on what the plugin *can* do.
  # If a direct JS bundle size check is critical and not covered by this plugin,
  # that would be a separate follow-up.

  # The plugin will automatically create 'lighthouse-reports' in the publish directory.
  # Netlify automatically makes build artifacts available from the publish directory.
