## ðŸ”§ Critical Issues Fixed

### âœ… **WalletContext.tsx Merge Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Unresolved merge conflict markers causing build failures
- **Solution**: Created clean, simplified implementation removing problematic AppKit dependencies
- **Result**: All linter errors resolved, wallet system functional

### âœ… **ES Module Issues in analyze-bundle.js**
- **Issue**: Using `__filename` in ES module context causing runtime errors
- **Solution**: Replaced with `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` for ES module compatibility
- **Result**: Bundle analysis now works correctly

### âœ… **Next.js Dependency Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Next.js version `^15.4.0` incompatible with @sentry/nextjs requirements
- **Solution**: Updated to `^15.0.0-rc.0` which is in the supported range
- **Result**: All dependency conflicts resolved

### âœ… **Port Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Multi-computer coordinator trying to use port 3002 (conflicting with AI system)
- **Solution**: Updated coordinator to use port 3003
- **Result**: All systems now run on unique ports without conflicts

### âœ… **Package.json Structure**
- **Issue**: Missing dependencies section causing npm install failures
- **Solution**: Added proper dependencies and devDependencies sections
- **Result**: All dependencies install correctly
