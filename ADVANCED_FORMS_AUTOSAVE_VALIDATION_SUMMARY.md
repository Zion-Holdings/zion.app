# 📝 Advanced Forms Auto-Save & Validation Summary

## 🔄 Auto-Save Functionality

- **Automatic Draft Saving**: Form data is automatically saved locally every few seconds to prevent data loss.
- **Restore on Reload**: If the page refreshes or the user returns later, the most recent form state is restored.
- **User Feedback**: A small indicator shows when the form was last auto-saved.

## ✅ Client-Side Validation

- **Real-Time Field Validation** using `react-hook-form` and `yup` schemas.
- **Inline Error Messages** display when users enter invalid data.
- **Submit Button Disabled** until all required fields are valid.

## 🚀 Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users can fill out long forms without fear of losing progress.
- **Higher Submission Success**: Validation catches issues early, reducing server-side errors.

**Location**: `src/components` (integrated across form components using hooks)
