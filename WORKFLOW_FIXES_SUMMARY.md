- **Failure Monitoring**: Creates issues for failed workflows

**Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["*"]
    types: [completed]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### 2. Enhanced Workflow Monitor (`automation/enhanced-workflow-monitor.cjs`)

**Capabilities:**
- Comprehensive workflow analysis
- Health scoring (0-100 scale)
- Issue categorization (critical, warnings, suggestions)
- Performance monitoring
- Resource usage analysis
- Detailed reporting and recommendations

**Health Scoring System:**
- **90-100**: Excellent - No issues
- **80-89**: Good - Minor warnings
- **70-79**: Fair - Some warnings
- **60-69**: Poor - Multiple issues
- **0-59**: Critical - Major problems

### 3. Automated Fix Scripts

**YAML Fixer** (`automation/fix-workflow-yaml.cjs`):
- Fixes syntax issues automatically
- Creates backups before changes
- Reports all fixes applied

**Comprehensive Fixer** (`comprehensive-workflow-fixer.py`):
- Fixes structural issues
- Adds missing sections
- Standardizes workflow format
- Creates comprehensive backups

## Files Modified

### Workflow Files Fixed: 193
- All files in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Backup files created with `.backup` extensions
- All workflows now follow consistent structure

### New Files Created:
1. `.github/workflows/workflow-auto-healer.yml` - Main auto-healing workflow
2. `automation/enhanced-workflow-monitor.cjs` - Advanced monitoring system
3. `comprehensive-workflow-fixer.py` - Python-based comprehensive fixer
4. `WORKFLOW_AUTO_HEALING_GUIDE.md` - Complete system documentation
5. `WORKFLOW_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary report
