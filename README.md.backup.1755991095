## 🚀 2025 Comprehensive Services Portfolio

Home: https://github.com/Zion-Holdings/zion#readme

- **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Located primarily in `src/` (for application code like components, hooks, pages using App Router) and `pages/` (for API routes and potentially older Pages Router content). This is the main user-facing application.
- **Backend API (Django):** Located in `backend/`. This Python-based backend serves core business logic and data management, likely interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Node.js Backend Services:**
  - **`server/`:** An Express.js application that provides additional API endpoints, potentially for specific features, BFF patterns, or integration tasks. It connects to MongoDB.
  - **`api/` (within `pages/api/` or `src/pages/api`):** Next.js API routes providing serverless backend functionality directly within the Next.js application.
- **Monitoring Service:** Located in `monitoring/`. A Node.js service for monitoring URL performance and health. (See `monitoring/README.md` for details).
- **Supabase Integration:** Utilizes Supabase for backend-as-a-service features, with functions in `supabase/functions/` and schema definitions in `prisma/` (Prisma is used with Supabase, and potentially also for the Django backend or other Node.js services).
- **Blockchain/DAO Components:** Directories like `dao/` and `token/` suggest features related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and cryptocurrency tokens.
- **SDK:** A software development kit is present in `sdk/`, likely for interacting with Zion platform services.
- **Documentation:** General documentation is in `docs/`, with specific component documentation potentially within their respective directories.
- **Testing:** Extensive test suites using Vitest and Cypress are in `tests/` and `cypress/`. See **[docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** for common QA steps.
- **Connect Portal:** Access the portal at `/portal` for account management and settings. The previous `/app` path is deprecated.

- **Database/BaaS:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, Prisma
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (handles login, signup, password reset, social auth) with optional two-factor authentication for the IPO portal
- **Monitoring:** Custom Node.js service, Sentry, Datadog
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Netlify (including Lighthouse CI)
- **Other:** IPFS, OrbitDB, Ethers.js, Elasticsearch

## Environment Configuration

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **Supabase for authentication** and **Netlify for environment variable management**. Proper configuration is essential for the application to function correctly.

## Zion Assistant Monorepo

Cross-platform assistant for hiring managers and remote workers.

### Apps
- `apps/api`: Fastify API (OpenAI, jobs, talent, projects, notifications)
- `apps/slack-bot`: Slack Bolt app with `/zion` slash commands and notifications
- `apps/extension`: Chrome/Edge MV3 extension with popup and background sync

### Quickstart
1. Copy env: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Start infra: `docker compose up -d`
3. Install deps: `pnpm i`
4. Run dev servers: `pnpm dev`
5. Build extension icons: `pnpm generate:icons`

### Slack
- Create a Slack app with OAuth scopes: `commands,chat:write,chat:write.public,users:read,app_mentions:read,channels:history`
- Set Slash commands:
  - `/zion` (dispatches subcommands)
  - `/zion-post-job`, `/zion-suggest-talent`, `/zion-track-project`, `/zion-help` (optional aliases)
- Redirect URL: `${SLACK_APP_REDIRECT_URL}`

### Google OAuth
- Create OAuth 2.0 Client (Web) with redirect `${GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI}`
- The extension uses `chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` to sign in

### Database & RLS
- Postgres initialized via `infra/db/init.sql` with RLS policies per `user_id`

### Rate limiting
- Implemented in API with Redis (fallback to in-memory)

### Branding
- Icon generator: run `pnpm --filter @zion/extension generate:icons` to produce PNGs from `zion.svg`
