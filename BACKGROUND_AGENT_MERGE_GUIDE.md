# Background Agent Merge System Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the background agent merge system works and how it solves the previous issues with agents not being able to merge changes into the main branch.

## Previous Issues

The background agents were failing to merge changes into main because of:

1. **Critical YAML syntax errors** in workflow files
2. **Aggressive git operations** that bypassed branch protection
3. **Missing conflict resolution** mechanisms
4. **Direct pushes to main** instead of proper pull request workflows

## New Architecture

### 1. Smart Merge Agent (`smart-merge-agent.yml`)

The new smart merge agent replaces direct pushes with a pull request-based workflow:

- **Runs every 15 minutes** to check for changes
- **Creates pull requests** instead of direct pushes
- **Automatically resolves conflicts** where possible
- **Respects branch protection rules**
- **Creates backup branches** before major operations

### 2. Enhanced Git Sync (`automation/git-sync.cjs`)

The git sync script has been improved with:

- **Conflict detection** before attempting operations
- **Multiple merge strategies** (simple merge → conflict resolution → fallback)
- **Automatic backup creation** for safety
- **Better error handling** and recovery
- **Configurable push behavior** (default: don't push to main)

### 3. Merge Conflict Guard (`merge-conflict-guard.yml`)

A new workflow that:

- **Monitors for merge conflicts** in real-time
- **Automatically resolves** common conflicts
- **Prevents broken states** from propagating
- **Runs on PR creation** and scheduled intervals

### 4. Workflow Auto-Healer (`workflow-auto-healer.yml`)

Automatically fixes broken workflows:

- **Validates all workflows** every 2 hours
- **Fixes common YAML issues** automatically
- **Creates pull requests** for fixes
- **Maintains workflow health** proactively

## How It Works

### Step 1: Change Detection
Background agents make changes and commit them to their working branches.

### Step 2: Smart Merge Process
1. **Smart Merge Agent** detects changes every 15 minutes
2. **Creates a new branch** for the changes
3. **Opens a pull request** with descriptive information
4. **Attempts auto-merge** if conditions are met

### Step 3: Conflict Resolution
If conflicts occur:
1. **Merge Conflict Guard** detects the issue
2. **Automatically resolves** conflicts where possible
3. **Creates backup branches** for safety
4. **Notifies developers** if manual intervention is needed

### Step 4: Safe Merging
1. **Pull request is reviewed** (automatically or manually)
2. **All checks pass** before merge
3. **Squash merge** for clean history
4. **Branch cleanup** after successful merge

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# For git-sync.cjs
PUSH_TO_MAIN=false          # Don't push directly to main
TARGET_BRANCH=main          # Target branch for sync
CREATE_BACKUP=true          # Create backup branches

# For smart-merge-agent.yml
# Configured in workflow file
```

### Workflow Triggers

- **Smart Merge Agent**: Every 15 minutes + workflow completion
- **Merge Conflict Guard**: On PR events + daily at 2 AM
- **Workflow Auto-Healer**: Every 2 hours + workflow failures
- **Rapid Git Sync**: Every hour + manual dispatch

## Safety Features

### 1. Backup Creation
- Automatic backup branches before major operations
- Timestamped backups for easy recovery
- Non-destructive operations

### 2. Conflict Resolution
- Intelligent conflict resolution for different file types
- Fallback strategies for complex conflicts
- Automatic rollback on failures

### 3. Branch Protection
- Respects repository branch protection rules
- Creates pull requests instead of direct pushes
- Requires proper approvals and checks

### 4. Error Recovery
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic cleanup of failed operations
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Health Check Script
```bash
./scripts/workflow-health-check.sh
```

This script provides:
- Overall workflow health status
- Specific issues with individual workflows
- Background agent workflow status
- Recommendations for fixes

### Fix All Workflows Script
```bash
./scripts/fix-all-workflows.sh
```

This script can:
- Fix all broken workflows automatically
- Create backups before changes
- Apply appropriate templates for different workflow types
- Provide detailed fix reports

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring
- Run health checks weekly
- Monitor workflow success rates
- Review auto-merge pull requests

### 2. Conflict Prevention
- Keep branches up to date
- Resolve conflicts early
- Use feature branches for major changes

### 3. Workflow Maintenance
- Let the auto-healer fix broken workflows
- Review and approve auto-fix pull requests
- Customize workflow templates as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflows Still Failing**
   - Run the health check script
   - Check for YAML syntax errors
   - Verify permissions and secrets

2. **Merge Conflicts Not Resolving**
   - Check the merge conflict guard logs
   - Review backup branches
   - Manual conflict resolution may be needed

3. **Background Agents Not Running**
   - Verify workflow files are valid YAML
   - Check GitHub Actions permissions
   - Ensure cron schedules are correct

### Getting Help

1. **Check workflow logs** in GitHub Actions
2. **Run health check scripts** for diagnostics
3. **Review backup branches** for recovery
4. **Check the workflow auto-healer** for automatic fixes

## Migration from Old System

### What Changed
- **No more direct pushes** to main branch
- **Pull request workflow** for all changes
- **Automatic conflict resolution** where possible
- **Better error handling** and recovery

### What Stays the Same
- **Background agent functionality** remains intact
- **Automated operations** continue as before
- **Scheduling and triggers** preserved
- **Integration with existing systems**

## Conclusion

The new background agent merge system provides:

✅ **Safe merging** through pull requests  
✅ **Automatic conflict resolution**  
✅ **Better error handling** and recovery  
✅ **Respect for branch protection**  
✅ **Comprehensive monitoring** and health checks  
✅ **Automatic workflow repair**  

This system ensures that background agents can reliably merge changes while maintaining code quality and repository integrity.
