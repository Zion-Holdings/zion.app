# 🛠️ DevOps & Maintenance Improvements Summary

## Overview
This summary highlights key enhancements that strengthen the project's operational reliability and routine maintenance. Automated audits, watchdog monitoring, and structured workflows keep the codebase healthy and secure.

## 🔄 Automated Maintenance Workflows
- **Hourly Checks** (`.github/workflows/hourly-check.yml`)
  - Runs security audits and Lighthouse performance checks every hour
  - Uploads audit reports for review
- **Weekly Maintenance** (`.github/workflows/weekly-audit.yml`)
  - Generates missing tests and formats code automatically
  - Stores an artifact `maintenance-audit.json` for tracking issues
- **Scheduled Audits** (`.github/workflows/scheduled-audits.yml`)
  - Executes `scripts/security-audit.sh` weekly to check dependencies
  - Integrates Python `pip-audit` for backend packages

## 🛡️ Watchdog Self‑Healing
- **Script**: `scripts/watchdog.js`
  - Monitors performance and security logs
  - Triggers a self‑heal command (`git pull && npm install && npm run build && pm2 restart all`) when repeated issues are detected
  - Sends optional alerts via Discord webhook
  - Tracks CPU and memory usage to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Support Scripts**
  - `scripts/clear-logs.js` cleans log files and resets the watchdog state
  - Logs are stored under `logs/` for easy inspection

## 🔍 Maintenance Utilities
- **Audit Script** (`scripts/maintenance/audit.sh`)
  - Runs `npm install` followed by `npm audit` to create `maintenance-audit.json`
- **Formatting Script** (`scripts/maintenance/format.sh`)
  - Applies ESLint and Prettier fixes across the repository
- **Test Generation** (`scripts/maintenance/generate-tests.js`)
  - Creates placeholder tests for files with less than 80% coverage

## ✅ Benefits
- Continuous security and dependency checks
- Automatic formatting keeps code style consistent
- Self‑healing reduces downtime by recovering from recurring errors
- Centralized logs and artifacts simplify troubleshooting
