# Remote DAO Test Environment

This example configures a governance module for disconnected or satellite-based regions.

- Proposals and votes are queued locally until a connection is restored.
- Data is synced via IPFS and OrbitDB when a low-latency link becomes available.
- Delay-tolerant logic ensures proposals finalize despite long round-trip times.

Run `node test-env.js` after installing dependencies to try it locally.
