# Cursor Memory Learning Automation System

## Overview

The Cursor Memory Learning Automation System is an intelligent system that automatically learns from past chats, conversations, and development interactions to build a comprehensive knowledge base for Cursor AI. This system extracts patterns, preferences, solutions, and insights from your project's history and creates structured memory files that can be used by Cursor to provide more contextual and personalized assistance.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Intelligent Knowledge Extraction

- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies common patterns in your development workflow
- **Preference Learning**: Learns your coding preferences and automation strategies
- **Solution Mining**: Extracts technical solutions and best practices from past interactions
- **Error Analysis**: Identifies common issues and their resolutions

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Memory Management

- **Memory Index**: Structured index of all learned knowledge with confidence scores
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relationship mapping between different concepts and solutions
- **Learning History**: Track of all learning sessions and their outcomes
- **Category Classification**: Automatic categorization of knowledge into relevant domains

### ðŸ”„ Automated Workflow

- **File Scanning**: Recursively scans project directories for chat logs and conversations
- **Content Analysis**: Uses AI (when available) or pattern-based extraction
- **Memory Generation**: Creates Cursor-compatible memory files
- **Continuous Learning**: Can be scheduled to run periodically

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Automation

```bash
# Run the memory learning automation
npm run cursor:memory

# Run in development mode with auto-restart
npm run cursor:memory:dev

# Check memory status
npm run cursor:memory:status

# View configuration
npm run cursor:memory:config
```

### 2. Generated Files

The automation creates several files in the `cursor-memory/` directory:

- `cursor-memory.json` - Main Cursor memory file
- `memory-index.json` - Detailed memory index with all entries
- `knowledge-graph.json` - Relationship mapping between concepts
- `learning-history.json` - History of learning sessions
- `memory-summary.json` - Summary statistics and metrics

### 3. Integration with Cursor

The generated `cursor-memory.json` file contains:

- **Rules**: Extracted workflow rules and preferences
- **Memories**: Specific insights and solutions
- **Context**: Project patterns, user preferences, and technical solutions

## Configuration

### cursor-memory-config.json

```json
{
  "automation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoRun": true,
    "interval": "1h",
    "maxMemoryEntries": 10000,
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.7
  },

    "maxTokens": 4000
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CursorMemoryAutomation** - Main automation class
2. **File Scanner** - Recursively scans for chat content
3. **Knowledge Extractor** - Extracts insights from content
4. **Memory Indexer** - Builds structured memory index
5. **Knowledge Graph Builder** - Creates relationship mappings
6. **Memory Generator** - Creates Cursor-compatible files

### Learning Process

1. **Scan**: Recursively scan project directories for chat logs
2. **Extract**: Use AI or pattern-based extraction to identify knowledge
3. **Categorize**: Classify knowledge into relevant categories
4. **Index**: Build structured memory index with confidence scores
5. **Relate**: Create knowledge graph with relationships
6. **Generate**: Create Cursor memory files

### Knowledge Categories

- **Technical Solutions**: Code patterns, implementations, fixes
- **Best Practices**: Coding standards, conventions, guidelines
- **User Preferences**: Workflow preferences, automation strategies
- **Error Handling**: Common issues and their resolutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Speed and efficiency improvements
- **Security Considerations**: Security patterns and practices
- **Automation Strategies**: Workflow automation approaches
- **Development Insights**: Project-specific learnings

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the automation
npm run cursor:memory

# Check what was learned
npm run cursor:memory:status
```

### Advanced Usage

```javascript
const CursorMemoryAutomation = require('./cursor-memory-automation.js');

const automation = new CursorMemoryAutomation();
await automation.run();
```

### Custom Configuration

```javascript
// Custom configuration
const config = {
  automation: {
    enabled: true,
    autoRun: true,
    interval: "30m"
  },
  scanning: {
    sources: ["./my-logs", "./conversations"],
    filePatterns: ["*.log", "*.txt"]
  }
};

// Save custom config
await fs.writeFile('./custom-config.json', JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));
```

## Memory Structure

### Rules

```json
{
  "id": "work-autonomously",
  "rule": "Work autonomously according to the best way to solve all the errors and improve the app",
  "source": "user-preferences",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### Memories

```json
{
  "id": "supabase-authentication",
  "content": "Full server-side authentication implemented using Supabase",
  "category": "authentication",
  "tags": ["supabase", "authentication", "next.js"],
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-06T08:00:45.845Z"

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Memory Metrics

- **Total Entries**: Number of memory entries created
- **Categories**: Number of different knowledge categories
- **Confidence Distribution**: High/medium/low confidence entries
- **Top Tags**: Most common tags and concepts
- **Recent Learnings**: Latest insights and patterns

### Performance Monitoring

- **Processing Time**: Time taken to scan and extract knowledge
- **File Count**: Number of files processed
- **Extraction Success Rate**: Percentage of successful extractions
- **Memory Growth**: Rate of memory accumulation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No chat logs found**
   - Check scanning sources in configuration
   - Verify file patterns include your log formats
   - Ensure files contain chat-like content

2. **Low confidence scores**
   - Content may not contain clear patterns
   - Consider adjusting confidence threshold
   - Review content quality and relevance

3. **Memory overflow**
   - Increase maxMemoryEntries in configuration
   - Implement memory cleanup strategies
   - Archive old entries

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=cursor-memory npm run cursor:memory

# Check specific files
npm run cursor:memory:config
npm run cursor:memory:status
```
