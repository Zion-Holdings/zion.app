# Zion OS Year 10 Scenario Planner

This planner explores potential futures for Zion OS ten years after launch. It tracks key variables across the network, describes narrative threads, and offers three alternate scenarios.

## Simulation Parameters

### Key Variables
- **Number of Zion instances**
- **Global ZION$ usage**
- **Talent passport issuances**
- **Nation‑token integrations**
- **DAO votes per month**
- **Percent of global freelance GDP on Zion**

### Narrative Threads
- AI governs 40% of global micro‑economies
- Zion protocol embedded in government ID systems
- ZionGPT writes 70% of job contracts
- ZION$ used for UN‑backed work credits

### Planned Outputs
- Visual world map (heatmap) of Zion reach
- **Scenario 1:** Protocol → Protocol Nation
- **Scenario 2:** Protocol under attack
- **Scenario 3:** Protocol adopted by 10 UN countries

### GPT Timeline Prompt
Project Zion in Year 10 with 1M users, global DAO synchronization, and AI‑generated governance. Forecast technology shifts, risks, and emerging use cases.

## Alternate Future Branches

### Scenario 1 – Protocol → Protocol Nation
Zion evolves from a marketplace protocol into an autonomous network nation. Talent flows freely across borders using Zion passports, and ZION$ becomes a global labor standard.

### Scenario 2 – Protocol Under Attack
Regulators challenge Zion's AI governance. Some nations restrict ZION$, causing forks of the protocol. The community responds with decentralized identity and dispute resolution layers.

### Scenario 3 – Protocol Adopted by 10 UN Countries
Ten UN member states integrate Zion into official employment systems. Work credits convert to ZION$ and feed back into local economies. Global freelance GDP on Zion reaches 12%.
