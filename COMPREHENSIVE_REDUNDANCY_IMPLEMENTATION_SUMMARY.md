- **Netlify Functions Monitoring**: Checks function manifest and critical functions availability
- **NPM Scripts Monitoring**: Validates critical build and automation scripts
- **Automatic Recovery**: Performs comprehensive recovery when health checks fail
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous health monitoring with configurable intervals

### 2. Enhanced Startup Script (`automation/start-comprehensive-redundancy.sh`)
- **Full System Management**: Start, stop, restart, status, health, and logs commands
- **Prerequisites Checking**: Validates Node.js, NPM, and PM2 installation
- **PM2 Process Management**: Automatically starts all ecosystem files
- **Health Validation**: Comprehensive system health checks
- **Logging**: Detailed logging with color-coded output

### 3. Comprehensive PM2 Ecosystem (`ecosystem-comprehensive-redundancy.pm2.cjs`)
- **All Redundancy Processes**: Includes all redundancy monitoring and recovery processes
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Multiple redundancy managers for different components
- **Automatic Restarts**: Configurable restart policies and failure thresholds
- **Log Management**: Comprehensive logging for all processes

### 4. Package.json Integration
- **New NPM Scripts**: Added comprehensive redundancy management commands
- **Easy Access**: Simple commands for starting, stopping, and monitoring the system
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing automation scripts

## Redundancy Coverage

- ✅ Quality assurance scripts (lint, type-check)
- ✅ Automation scripts (automation:all, redundancy:start, etc.)

## System Features

### Health Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- **Component Isolation**: Individual health monitoring for each system component

- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for failed components

### Logging and Reporting
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for all operations and health checks
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log rotation with configurable size and retention
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time status reporting and health metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error tracking and failure analysis

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **PM2 Recovery**: Automatic PM2 process restart and ecosystem management
- **Workflow Recovery**: Backup workflow activation when main workflows fail
- **Function Recovery**: Automatic Netlify function manifest regeneration
- **Script Recovery**: NPM script validation and dependency restoration

## Usage Commands

### System Management
```bash
# Start the comprehensive redundancy system
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:start
# or
./automation/start-comprehensive-redundancy.sh start

# Stop the system
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:stop

# Restart the system
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:restart

# Check system status
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:status

# Run health check
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:health

# View logs
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:logs
```

### Direct System Control
```bash
# Start the redundancy system directly
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:system

# Check system status
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:status:check

# Run health check
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:health:check

# Trigger recovery
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:recover

# Start PM2 ecosystem
npm run redundancy:pm2:comprehensive
```

## Configuration

### Monitoring Intervals
- **PM2 Health Check**: 30 seconds
- **GitHub Actions Check**: 1 minute
- **Netlify Functions Check**: 2 minutes
- **Overall Health Check**: 1 minute

### Failure Thresholds
- **PM2**: 5 restart attempts
- **GitHub Actions**: 3 failures before recovery
- **Netlify Functions**: 2 failures before recovery
- **Overall System**: 3 failures before recovery

### Recovery Timeouts
- **PM2 Recovery**: 5 seconds
- **GitHub Recovery**: 5 minutes
- **Netlify Recovery**: 10 minutes
- **Overall Recovery**: 5 minutes

## Build Status

### Pre-build Health Checks
- ✅ Page Structure Validation: PASS
- ✅ Dependencies Check: PASS
- ✅ Next.js Configuration: PASS
- ⚠️ Environment Variables: FAIL (Missing NODE_VERSION, NODE_OPTIONS - non-critical)
- ✅ File Permissions: PASS
- ✅ Build Artifacts: PASS

### Build Process
- ✅ Linting: PASS (no errors)
- ✅ Type Checking: PASS (no errors)
- ✅ Next.js Build: PASS (successful compilation)
- ✅ Page Validation: PASS (all pages properly structured)

## System Health Status

### Current Status: HEALTHY ✅

- **GitHub Actions**: Healthy (all workflows validated)
- **Netlify Functions**: Healthy (97 functions found, manifest valid)
- **NPM Scripts**: Healthy (all critical scripts available)
- **Overall System**: Healthy (all components operational)

## Benefits

### Reliability
- **Continuous Operation**: System continues running even when individual components fail
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities reduce manual intervention
- **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple layers of redundancy ensure system availability
