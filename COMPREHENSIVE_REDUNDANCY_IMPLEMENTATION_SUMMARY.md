  "redundancy:netlify:comprehensive": "node automation/comprehensive-netlify-functions-redundancy.cjs"
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Start All Redundancy Systems
```bash
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:start
```

### Check System Health
```bash
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:health
```

### View System Status
```bash
npm run redundancy:comprehensive:status
```

### Individual System Management
```bash
# PM2 Redundancy
npm run redundancy:pm2:comprehensive health
npm run redundancy:pm2:comprehensive status

# GitHub Actions Redundancy
npm run redundancy:github:comprehensive health
npm run redundancy:github:comprehensive recovery

# Netlify Functions Redundancy
npm run redundancy:netlify:comprehensive health
npm run redundancy:netlify:comprehensive recovery
```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Recovery

### Health Checks
- **PM2**: Every 25 seconds
- **GitHub Actions**: Every 60 seconds
- **Netlify Functions**: Every 90 seconds
- **Build System**: Every 120 seconds
- **Overall System**: Every 60 seconds

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **PM2**: Automatic process restart and ecosystem reload
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow restoration from backups and regeneration
- **Netlify Functions**: Function regeneration and manifest updates
- **Build System**: Dependency installation and build validation

### Logging
- All systems log to `automation/logs/`
- Daily log rotation with 50MB max size
- JSON health reports generated daily
- Comprehensive error tracking and reporting

## ✅ Testing Results
