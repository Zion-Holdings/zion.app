# Zion OS SDK API Overview

## Purpose

The Zion OS SDK aims to provide a unified and developer-friendly interface for interacting with the various services and functionalities offered by the Zion OS ecosystem. This SDK will enable developers to seamlessly integrate Zion OS features into their applications across different platforms.

## Core Principles

The design and development of the Zion OS SDK will adhere to the following core principles:

- **Abstraction:** The SDK will abstract the underlying complexities of the Zion OS services, offering a simplified and intuitive API for developers.
- **Ease of Use:** The SDK will be designed for ease of use, with clear documentation, consistent naming conventions, and straightforward integration processes.
- **Consistency:** The SDK will maintain consistency across different platforms (JavaScript, Python, CLI), allowing developers to switch between environments with minimal friction.
- **Modularity:** The SDK will be modular, allowing developers to include only the specific components they need for their applications.
- **Extensibility:** The SDK will be designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and services as the Zion OS ecosystem evolves.

## Authentication

The Zion OS SDK will support multiple authentication mechanisms to cater to different use cases:

- **Email/Password:** Traditional email and password-based authentication.
- **Wallet Authentication:** Integration with popular cryptocurrency wallets for secure authentication.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Support for SSO providers for enterprise-level integrations.

The SDK will handle token management and session persistence internally, providing a seamless authentication experience for developers. Secure storage of authentication tokens will be prioritized.

## Error Handling

The SDK will implement a standardized error handling mechanism. Errors returned by the API will be consistent and provide clear, actionable information. This will include error codes, human-readable messages, and potentially context-specific details to aid in debugging. Exceptions will be used for exceptional circumstances, and the SDK will provide clear guidance on how to handle them.
