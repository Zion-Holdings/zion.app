                  Autonomous systems face security challenges that traditional IT systems don't encounter:

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  AI systems that continuously learn and adapt can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs. 
                  Attackers can exploit this by feeding malicious data that gradually shifts the system's behavior 
                  toward undesirable outcomes.
                </p>

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Many autonomous systems operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand why they make 
                  certain decisions. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to detect when a system has been 
                  compromised or is behaving maliciously.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-orange-300">Real-Time Response Requirements</h3>
                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Autonomous systems often need to respond to threats in real-time, leaving little room for human 
                  intervention. This creates a race between attackers and defenders that happens at machine speed.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns that indicate 
                  potential threats. These systems can detect anomalies in system behavior, network traffic, and 
                  user interactions that might escape traditional rule-based security tools.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-yellow-300">Behavioral Analysis</h3>
                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  By establishing baseline behavior patterns for autonomous systems, security tools can identify 
                  deviations that might indicate compromise. This approach is particularly effective for detecting 
                  sophisticated attacks that don't trigger traditional signature-based detection.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Traditional perimeter-based security models are insufficient for autonomous systems that operate 
                  across multiple environments and networks. Zero Trust Architecture provides a more robust approach:

                  AI-powered security tools can automatically respond to threats by isolating compromised systems, 
                  blocking malicious traffic, and initiating recovery procedures. This reduces response time and

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  Comprehensive logging and monitoring enable detailed forensic analysis after security incidents. 
                  This information is crucial for understanding how attacks occurred and preventing future incidents.
