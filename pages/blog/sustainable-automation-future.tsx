                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  While automation has traditionally focused on efficiency and productivity, the environmental costs have often 
                  been overlooked. Traditional industrial automation systems typically consume significant amounts of energy 
                  and can generate substantial waste.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  However, the next generation of autonomous systems is changing this paradigm by incorporating sustainability 
                  as a core design principle rather than an afterthought.
