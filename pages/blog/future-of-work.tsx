                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  The future of work isn't about AI replacing humans—it's about AI augmenting human capabilities 
                  and creating new forms of collaboration that leverage the best of both worlds. 
                  At Zion Tech Group, we're building the tools and systems that make this collaboration 
                  seamless and productive.

                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  This revolution is already happening across industries, from healthcare to finance, 
                  from manufacturing to creative services. The question isn't whether AI will change work—it's 
                  how we can best harness its potential to create better outcomes for everyone.

                  freeing humans to focus on what they do best: creative problem-solving, strategic thinking, 
                  and human interaction.
