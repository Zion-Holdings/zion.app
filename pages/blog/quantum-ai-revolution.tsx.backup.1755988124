              <p className="text-white/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                While the potential is enormous, significant challenges remain. Quantum computers are still 
                in their infancy, with limited qubit counts and high error rates. However, companies like 
                IBM, Google, and startups are making rapid progress.
