                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  With great power comes great responsibility. As AI systems become more autonomous 
                  and capable, the ethical implications of their decisions become increasingly important.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  At Zion Tech Group, we believe that ethical AI development is not just a legal 
                  requirement—it's a moral imperative that guides everything we do.

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  One of the key ethical principles in AI development is transparency. Our autonomous 
                  systems are designed to provide clear explanations for their decisions, allowing 
                  users to understand how and why certain actions were taken.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  This transparency builds trust and enables human oversight, ensuring that AI systems 
                  remain accountable for their actions.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-green-400">Bias and Fairness</h2>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases in the data they're 
                  trained on. We implement rigorous testing and validation processes to identify and 
                  mitigate potential biases.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  Our systems are designed to treat all users fairly, regardless of their background, 
                  ensuring equitable access to our automation services.

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  Privacy is fundamental to ethical AI development. Our systems are designed with 
                  privacy by design principles, ensuring that personal data is protected and used 
                  only for its intended purpose.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  We implement robust data protection measures and comply with all relevant privacy

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  While our AI systems are highly autonomous, human oversight remains essential. 
                  We maintain human control over critical decisions and provide mechanisms for 
                  human intervention when necessary.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that AI systems enhance human capabilities 
                  rather than replace human judgment entirely.

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  Safety is paramount in autonomous systems. Our AI systems undergo rigorous safety 
                  testing and are designed with multiple layers of protection to prevent harm.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  We implement robust security measures to protect against malicious attacks and

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  Ethical AI development is an ongoing process. We regularly review and update our
