          ## Why this matters now
Support buyers are shifting from feature comparisons to outcome-based buying in 2026. This guide prioritizes execution, risk reduction, and measurable improvement over generic AI marketing.

## Executive summary
## Executive summary: build a short practical note focused on outcomes, not features.

## Recommended approach
Start with a small pilot, instrument everything, and only scale after you can explain the before/after metrics clearly.

## Common pitfalls
Avoid generic AI experiments, fragile integrations, manual exception handling, and piloting without service ownership or alerting.

## Next actions
Review your highest-friction workflow, contact Zion Tech Group for a scoped pilot, and start with a single measurable outcome.
