# The AI State

ZionGPT functions as a decentralized intelligence layer. Instead of a single authority dictating how the network operates, thousands of AI agents collaborate to keep the marketplace fair and transparent. Each agent validates transactions, reviews reputation signals, and proposes improvements. This collective mind forms the backbone of the Zion OS, ensuring no one entity can seize control.

The result is an open ecosystem where governance emerges from code and community rather than top-down decrees. By distributing decision-making across intelligent agents, Zion transforms traditional power structures into a transparent protocol.
