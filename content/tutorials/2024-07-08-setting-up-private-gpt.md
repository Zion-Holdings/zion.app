This tutorial walks through preparing your data, running the fine-tuning script, and deploying a private GPT endpoint for internal use.

## 1. Gather and Clean Training Data

Collect text samples relevant to your organization. Remove any sensitive information and check for formatting issues. The quality of your dataset directly impacts model performance.

## 2. Configure the Training Environment

Install the necessary libraries such as `transformers` and `datasets`. Ensure you have adequate GPU resources or use a cloud provider that supports large model training.

## 3. Run the Fine-Tuning Script

Use the provided script to fine-tune the base GPT model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size to achieve the best results.

## 4. Evaluate the Model

After training completes, test the model on sample prompts. Review the output for accuracy and adjust your data or training settings if necessary.

## 5. Deploy a Private Endpoint

Once satisfied with the model, containerize it with Docker and deploy to your preferred hosting solution. Restrict network access so only internal applications can reach the API.

## 6. Maintain and Update

Periodically retrain the model with new data to keep responses accurate. Monitor performance and resource usage to ensure your private GPT continues to serve users effectively.
