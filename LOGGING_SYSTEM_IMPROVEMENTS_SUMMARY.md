// Log an error (automatically collected and analyzed)
logError('Something went wrong', error, { userId: '123', action: 'checkout' });

// Get system health metrics
const metrics = await logDashboard.getDashboardMetrics();

// Generate system health report
const report = await logDashboard.generateHealthReport();

// Analyze system health
const analysis = await logManagement.analyzeSystemHealth();
```
