# 📝 Logs Health Summary (2025-07-06)

## Overview

A quick review of `next_dev_server.log` and `logs/self-heal.log` shows no runtime errors. However, attempts to build and test locally failed due to missing dependencies.

## Findings

- **Build Failed**: `npm run build` reports missing modules such as `react` and `react-dom`.
- **Tests Unavailable**: `npm run test` indicates Jest and Vitest are not installed.
- **Logs**: No new errors in `next_dev_server.log` or `logs/self-heal.log`.

## Recommendation

Run `./setup.sh npm` to install dependencies before building or running tests.
