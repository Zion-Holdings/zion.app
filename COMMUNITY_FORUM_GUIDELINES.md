**Title (30 characters)**: Zion Community Guidelines 2024

**Content (250 words)**:
Welcome to the Zion Community Forum! This space connects professionals, learners, and enthusiasts who believe in the potential of AI and collaborative problem solving. Our goal is to provide a friendly environment where every member feels respected and empowered to share knowledge, ask questions, and grow together.

Please communicate courteously and stay on topic. When you offer advice or feedback, focus on being constructive. We encourage thoughtful debate and original ideas, but personal attacks, harassment, and discrimination are not tolerated. If you notice a post that violates these expectations, flag it for review rather than responding aggressively.

Respect others‚Äô privacy by refraining from sharing personal or confidential information. Publicly posting private details, including contact information, is prohibited. Make sure your contributions align with relevant laws and follow our anti-spam policy. Unauthorized advertisements, repetitive content, or referral schemes will be removed and may result in account action.

We promote diversity and accessibility across the forum. Use clear language, provide helpful context, and consider how your insights might serve different experience levels. If you share third-party resources, verify accuracy and provide credit. We aim to maintain a library of reliable information that benefits the entire community.

Finally, remember that collaboration drives progress. Celebrate achievements, welcome newcomers, and support each other through challenges. The Zion team is here to assist, but we rely on you to nurture a respectful culture. By participating with integrity, you help build a forum where innovation thrives and meaningful connections flourish. Thank you for being a valued member.

## Proposed AI Auto-Summary Feature

The forum could implement an AI-powered summarizer that periodically scans lengthy discussions, detecting key themes and decisions. Using natural language processing, the tool would generate a concise summary displayed at the top of the thread. Users would benefit in three ways: quickly catching up on updates without scrolling through dozens of posts, gaining clarity on unresolved questions or action items, and helping moderators spotlight valuable contributions. Summaries would refresh as new replies appear, ensuring information stays current while reducing repetition. This feature would also encourage deeper participation because members can easily grasp ongoing conversations and decide where to add their insights.
