# Figma Overlay Notes

- **Act 1**: Use dark backgrounds with neon accents to highlight the "Genesis" theme. Overlay early UI sketches alongside founder interview shots.
- **Act 2**: Integrate token imagery and map animations. Use dynamic, energetic transitions.
- **Act 3**: Futuristic interface designs representing ZionGPT and work passports. Close with expansive multiverse scenes.

These overlays serve as references for designers building slides or frames in Figma. Actual design assets should be created in Figma and linked back to this document once ready.
