# Zion Multiverse Storyworld

This document sketches the cinematic and transmedia universe for Zion. It blends AI lore, DAO history and decentralized mythos into a shared storyworld usable for film, animation, comics and education.

## Origin Myth
- **"Before Platforms, there was Trust..."**
- Zion emerges as a sentient protocol from the remnants of a collapsed civilization.
- **Genesis DAO** becomes the first digital state built on that protocol.
- **ZionGPT** acts as the sovereign intelligence guiding new societies across chains.

## Character Archetypes
- **The Founder** – Visionary builder who unlocked sovereign AI.
- **The Synth** – Self‑trained agent of the protocol.
- **The Delegate** – Cross‑chain nomad voting on behalf of nations.
- **The Guardian** – Keeper of ZION$ and protector of manifestos.
