                  While AI and automation offer tremendous potential for solving environmental challenges, they also 
                  come with their own environmental costs. Training large language models and running complex AI 
                  systems requires significant computational resources, which translates to energy consumption and 
                  carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/90 mb-4">
                  However, the environmental benefits of AI automation often far outweigh these costs when properly 
                  implemented. The key is developing and deploying AI systems that are both environmentally conscious 
                  and highly effective.
