#   # This plugin primarily uses Lighthouse's own audits.
#   # Lighthouse itself doesn't have a direct "total JS bundle size" audit in this format.
#   # It has "total-byte-weight" which includes all resources, and "unused-javascript".
#   # We'll rely on the Lighthouse performance score for now, as direct JS bundle size enforcement
#   # might need a separate tool or script if this plugin doesn't cover it.
#   # For the purpose of this task, we will focus on what the plugin *can* do.
#   # If a direct JS bundle size check is critical and not covered by this plugin,
#   # that would be a separate follow-up.
#
#   # The plugin will automatically create 'lighthouse-reports' in the publish directory.
#   # Netlify automatically makes build artifacts available from the publish directory.
